Conservative,"I think you are missing the point of being a Conservative. That is to conserve good ideas instead of throwing them away.   Again, you can accept it and adapt but you have no right to complain when things turn out worse and not the way you would like.  Seems like you shouldn't really be involved or care about politics if you just allow the current climate to shape your view."

Conservative,"Populism isn't about philosophy or principles, it is about speaking to the American public in a way that motivates and inspires them.  Reagan did that. He won nearly every state not because he was conservative, but because of the way he talked about America.  Trump is doing the same thing except he isn't as eloquent as Reagan and he is speaking during a time of uncertainty.  Sanders has a different populist message, one that is anti-capitalism. His message resonates with the young and naive. It is very easy to be a populist to the younger generation.  Trump being able to speak to middle America is a testament to the power of his message."

Conservative,"&gt;  **Article:**  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was among the administration officials who listened in on the July 25 phone call between President Trump and Ukraine’s president, a senior State Department official said Monday, a disclosure that ties the State Department more closely to the House impeachment inquiry.  Mr. Pompeo’s participation on the call, which hadn’t been previously reported, was one of several developments related to the controversy that centers on Mr. Trump’s repeated urging that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky cooperate with Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump’s personal attorney, and Attorney General William Barr, on investigations into Mr. Trump’s political opponents, including Democratic rival Joe Biden.  Also Monday, House committees subpoenaed Mr. Giuliani to turn over documents related to his communications with Trump administration officials about his efforts in Ukraine, as well as any other documents related to that effort, by Oct. 15. They said the subpoena was formally part of the impeachment inquiry. Mr. Giuliani said on Twitter that the subpoena “will be given appropriate consideration,” noting that the subpoena was “signed only by Democrat Chairs who have prejudged this case.”  The impeachment inquiry is focused on Mr. Trump’s dealings with Ukraine. Lawmakers are focusing on a whistleblower complaint by a person identified as an officer at the Central Intelligence Agency and a record of the call between the two presidents that was released by the administration. If the Democrats approve articles of impeachment, the matter would move to trial in the Senate, which Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell confirmed Monday he would hold.  “I would have no choice but to take it up,” the Kentucky Republican said on CNBC. He added: “How long you are on it is a different matter, but I would have no choice but to take it up based on a Senate rule on impeachment.”  The scrutiny of the call with Ukraine—which came at a time when Mr. Trump had ordered U.S. aid to Ukraine put on hold—has prompted a wider examination of efforts by the Trump administration to engage foreign leaders in assisting with issues important to the president.  Mr. Barr has asked Mr. Trump to make introductions to a number of foreign officials he believes may have information relevant to the Justice Department’s review of the origins of the Russia investigation and has held overseas meetings with some of them, a Justice Department official said Monday. Mr. Trump recently called Australia’s prime minister at Mr. Barr’s request, two government officials said, to ask him to help with the inquiry.  Mr. Barr in May tapped John Durham, the top federal prosecutor in Connecticut, to lead the review. It focuses on the counterintelligence investigation that became special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Russian election meddling. Since then, Mr. Durham has been exploring what role if any various countries including Ukraine played in the counterintelligence probe. The Justice Department has revealed that “certain Ukrainians who are not members of the government” had volunteered information to Mr. Durham.  The department official wouldn’t say from which other countries Mr. Barr is seeking information. The attorney general was in Italy last week speaking to government officials in connection with Mr. Durham’s review.  The official described Mr. Barr’s request that Mr. Trump speak to Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison as standard, saying “It is typical protocol for one leader to contact another leader” for such a request.  “The Australian government has always been ready to assist and cooperate with efforts that help shed further light on the matters under investigation,” according to a statement from the Australian government. “The PM confirmed this readiness once again in conversation with the president.”  White House spokesman Hogan Gidley on Monday said: “The DOJ simply requested that the President provide introductions to facilitate that ongoing inquiry, and he did so, that’s all.”  Mr. Trump and his Republican congressional allies have long alleged that his associates were unfairly targeted for surveillance, and that investigators in the Justice Department and the FBI were politically prejudiced against Mr. Trump in a way that could have affected their work. Mr. Trump has said he believes Mr. Durham’s review will show crimes were comFmitted by his political opponents.  Mr. Pompeo was scheduled to depart for a European trip later Monday. He said last week that he hadn’t yet read the whistleblower’s complaint in its entirety, but said that to his knowledge, actions by State Department officials had been “entirely appropriate and consistent” with administration efforts to improve relations with Ukraine.  In those comments, during the United Nations General Assembly meeting, he didn’t mention his own participation in the call, but said the complaint was filed by “someone who had secondhand knowledge.”  Several days earlier, Mr. Pompeo said that he opposed releasing the record of the Trump-Zelensky call. He told “Fox News Sunday” in a Sept. 22 interview that he would defer to the White House on whether to do so.  “Those are private conversations between world leaders, and it’s not often that those are released,” he said in the interview. And when they’re [released], it’s done when the White House deems it appropriate.” Mr. Pompeo dismissed a question about details of the call, saying, “There’s a lot going on in the world.”  Three House committees—Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight — on Friday subpoenaed Mr. Pompeo for documents related to the inquiry; he has until Oct. 4 to produce them.  The committees plan to depose former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch ; U.S. special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker ; Deputy Assistant Secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs George Kent; counselor Ulrich Brechbuhl ; and U.S. Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland.  Mr. Volker resigned his post last week. Mr. Sondland said he planned to attend the deposition. The State Department did not respond to questions about plans by other officials who were asked to appear.  In Ukraine, Mr. Zelensky said Monday that his administration wouldn’t release a transcript of the July phone call with Mr. Trump, while also saying he is open to investigating any alleged violation of Ukrainian law.  At the White House on Monday afternoon, Mr. Trump told reporters: “We’re trying to find out about a whistleblower.” He didn’t expand on that, and the White House didn’t immediately respond to a question about the comment.  Mr. Trump has said he deserved to confront the whistleblower and anyone who provided him information and has suggested they are spies who committed treasonous acts. House Democrats are eager to hear testimony from the whistleblower—though in a way that will protect his identity.  Shortly after Mr. Trump’s comment, Andrew P. Bakaj, a lawyer who represents the whistleblower wrote on Twitter: “The Intel Community Whistleblower is entitled to anonymity. Law and policy support this and the individual is not to be retaliated against. Doing so is a violation of federal law.”  The Republican-led Senate is considered unlikely to convict Mr. Trump in any impeachment trial. Removing the president requires approval by two-thirds of the 100-member Senate.  Some Senate Republicans have voiced concern over the allegations outlined in a whistleblower complaint made public last week, but none has voiced support for impeachment."

democrats,"I largely agree.  Trumpler has already openly articulated his intent toward all the basics of martial law: Suppression of the media, the power to shut down and censor the internet when and where he pleases, shutting down protests, etc.  And he will either deliberately or through ineptitude allow a pretext to occur in relatively short order in power, since he already exploits even small-scale terrorism (except for the attacks perpetrated by his followers, of course).

The more the media pushes the narrative that Hillary is leading in the polls, the bigger effect is has on potential Trump voters who might stay home on election night if they don't think their guy can win.  Same kind of manipulation as what they did the day before the California primary by announcing that Hillary had enough votes to get the nom.  A tricky way to get the Bernie voters to stay home.  The media is our biggest enemy, not only in the election, but in the way they manipulate the country for political purposes."
Conservative,"Cruz had a reasonable proposal; ban immigration from high-risk areas.  The idea of banning anyone who holds a particular faith is contrary to the first amendment, and is unrealistic anyway.

His fans are the true useful idiots."

Now, before you go on and say this isn't crossdressing, I agree. THIS isn't crossdressing. This is forced and the mother is a dumbshit. However, if a boy WANTED to wear a dress, then let him wear a fucking dress. It's not that big of a fucking deal. THIS SPECIFIC CASE is abuse and neglect. Just like convertion therapy is."

I don't like welfare for most Americans, why would I want to give it to non-Americans too?  They can vote for whomever they please, in my opinion, and I think it's just as likely that they'll vote for us as they will vote for them. The Democrats, however, care about them because they are alive, just like you or I care about unborn babies because they are alive.  I find it kind of amusing when someone asks me if I care more about an unborn child than a refugee and expects me to side with them. They're both a life. You have your favorite, I have mine.

The price of guns in the black market once they have been banned doesn't just go up a little bit compared to retail price. For example, the gun used in the Sandy Hook massacre costs about $1500 give or take a few hundred. In the UK and Australia, which both obviously have banned guns, that same gun costs about $35,000 on the black market. Now I know the US and AUS/UK are very different countries, but that's a substantial increase in price. I just don't see too many lazy, bum, drug addicted- thugs being able to afford them..."
Conservative,"https://heritageaction.com/scorecard/members/G000571/113  This session is before Trump but you'll find that she's ""Average Democrat"" overall and scores between 0% and 15% on the Heritage Foundation recommendations for each session it has for her.

Some of the most important parts of the institution of marriage are the rights that are granted by it. Only the government can grant that.

Conservative,"&gt;Clinton left office with a budget surplus largely because Newt forced social spending reform (look it up).   As I said, he won a battle and lost the war. George W. Bush confirmed it with his centrist campaign and compassionate conservatism. Newt had to fight like hell to balance a budget, 0 debt was paid down and after 8 years the national debt went up.   &gt;We haven't managed that since, and Trump is promising not to touch entitlements.    Such a promise to touch them would make you happy yet guarantee his loss  and the loss of anyone in the Senate or House that promised the same. That ship sailed with the tea party and when Republicans refused to back Ron Paul.    &gt;The debt went up when Bush cranked up military spending and started a war in Iraq without taking on social security and Medicare.  Trump is planning on repeating the ""crank up spending and don't touch entitlements"" plan.    This isn't my first rodeo, I have been following politics for 17 years now. I probably agree with Trump on 50% of the issues. In contrast I probably agree with Cruz on 90% and Rand on 95%.  &gt;And I'll let you decide if Trump going after Khan did good things for his polls.  I think Newt was right.  I think it may have hurt him only because he was dealing with a gold star family.    "

Conservative,"If you're afraid of a sentiment just because it sounds a little bit too much like your opposition, maybe you have the wrong reasons for having those beliefs.  The fact is, Repealing GS only led to MORE Government control of the banking system, because they had their own hands in the larger banks. I don't believe that was the reason for the crash, and I never said that. The market crash was because of Clinton's irresponsible housing policy, but repealing GS doesn't help banks compete, or achieve Free Market ideals. It does the opposite by allowing the Federal Banks to be larger players than they should be.  It's no secret Politicians get away with insider trading and get the best rates on investments.

Conservative,"it is my premise that you can criticize the expansion of Israeli Settlements that are deemed illegal by the international community and *also* condemn the heinous act of slaughtering an innocent child.  There are few issues at your comments core:  1. not all Palestinians are muslim and not all Israelis are jewish.  2. This expansion is against the Oslo Accord and violates the Fourth Geneva Convention(Israel disputes this) which makes it illegal  3. Israel isn't building ""close"" to the West Bank, they are building ***in*** it, against international policy   In regards to the article, Mr. Shapiro simply misleads the reader with half-truths or, something i find comical because ""the right"" so vehemently opposes it, word policing.  &gt; leftists believe should be made Judenrein  Judenrein refers back to Nazis who used it to say an area was free/cleansed of Jews. Ben is basically say that anyone opposed to the Israeli expansion is a Nazi. Congrats Ben, you are just as bad as the ""leftists"" you so detest.  &gt; Both the headline and the lead sentence from The New York Times said that the attack happened in a “settlement” in the so-called West Bank, as though that were relevant – Arabs have attacked Jews in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv with similar alacrity. The Washington Post led with this headline: “Palestinian fatally stabs sleeping Israeli girl in West Bank settlement.” Leftist newspaper Ha’aretz headlined, “Israeli girl dies from her wounds after being stabbed at home in bed in West Bank settlement.”  Half-true and word policing. [NYT Article in question](http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2016/06/30/world/middleeast/ap-ml-israel-palestinians.html) ""Settlement"" is missing from the headline in NYT AND Haaretz. [WaPo Article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/palestinian-fatally-stabs-sleeping-israeli-girl-in-west-bank-settlement/2016/06/30/2a65d6fd-7dff-47d0-8a50-51ca033ce2f1_story.html). [haaretz article](http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.728013) Also, they stated that it is a settlement because that's what it is and that is where the stabbing took place, in a settlement in the West Bank. When the attacks take place in Tel Aviv, they say that the attack took place in Tel Aviv, what a coincidence! Ben is just word policing to drum up outrage here. EDIT: I would also like to note that Haaretz doesn't even mention the fact that the settlements in the West Bank are considered illegal.  &gt; And within hours of the girl's funeral, the diplomatic UN quartet -- the United Nations, the European Union, the United States, and Russia -- came out and called for Israel to stop “expansion of settlements in Palestinian territories.”  One has little to do with the other.  The international community has always been against these expansions, so the poor girls death has little influence on their diplomatic decisions. The UN quartet is trying to revive peace talks and says ""the West Bank was one of three ""negative trends"" that must be quickly reversed to keep the hope of an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal alive.""

Honestly, if your that concerned with an active duty members health and well being look at congress and [ask what are they doing to help the military](http://militaryadvantage.military.com/2016/05/senate-panel-military-pay-raise-caps-should-continue/).

Conservative,"I find it seriously funny that the author of the article uses ""incompetance and depravity"" when talking about Mr Trump.. I have to assume, in that case, he's voting for Clinton, who is the epitomy of incompetance and depravity.. Think about this: Trump says things that people don't like.. Clinton has blood on her hands from the deaths at Bengazi, plus all of the corruption that follows her and her husband around...  I do agree with the authors claim that early voting *is* bad for America.. So would a Clinton presidency.. However, thanks to early voting, I've already cast my ballot for Mr Trump, and pray to God that he wins."
Conservative,"&gt;Despite these ongoing scandals, Clinton’s close yet questionable ties to media outlets such as Google, CNN, PBS and The New York Times have seemed to pay off. These entities have gone out of their way to censor negative stories about Clinton, particularly ones involving the Clinton Foundation. There’s one common thread though these media outlets suppressing harmful Clinton stories all share: they’ve donated to the Clinton Foundation."
Conservative,Claiming to know his policies is naive considering he changes them daily. The reason why I'm not voting Trump or Hillary is because I don't want either to be president. Voting for one bad candidate to spite the other is like cutting off your your nose to spite your face and it subverts our democracy. If we lower the bar so that conservatives only need less terrible candidates than the left there's no reason for them to find an actually good candidate.

Conservative,"You're right. There's no real way to indict Hillary without bringing Obama into the mix.   ""Legacy"" might be a strong word.   Obama has always claimed to have heard of Hillary's illegal server through the ""media"", but that's simply a lie that falls flat on the surface.   Either Obama knew that his own SoS was using an insecure, illegal server and just let it go, or Obama is too stupid to realize that his SoS is using an insecure, illegal server because he's a dipshit surrounded by ""yes"" men.    Obama is at least intelligent enough to pick the right poison.   "

But we can expect martial law in 2017 or 18 following some major terrorist attack that the ineptitude and corruption of his cronies, deliberate or coincidental, allows to happen.  These ""establishment politicians"" will become increasingly physically terrified of the regime surrounding them, their criticisms muted to the point of silence.  A lot of them will retire rather than continue to watch their nation dismantled.  Some will become collaborators while the nation is crying out for them to stand up.  A few will speak up, but quietly and with obvious fear, their words measured with painful care.  Even that will invoke furious retaliation from Glorious Leader.  That is the reality this country faces from these corrupt maniacs.

Conservative,What polls are these?   Right now RCP average in AZ is Clinton +0.6 with his best poll is the CBS/YouGov poll which has him up by only 2%. The RCP average in GA is Trump +3.6% and his best poll is SuveryUSA which has him at +7  Texas is off the table but mostly because Hillary would be crazy to bother not because Trump has it locked up. Trump is up only 5% which is within striking distance for Hillary but it's a huge state that Hillary doesn't need. Trump needs to sweep the states in the Toss-Up column while Hillary has to win only one of them. Utah meanwhile is definitely in play. Trump is up by only ~3% if you exclude the YouGov/CBS poll which excluded McMullin. Maybe those third party voters will come home to Trump but the trend line is going McMullin's way and with his polling at ~30% people are less likely to see it as throwing away their vote.  The latest news hurts Hillary and may move the needle in enough states to give Trump an outside chance but it's still very much an uphill climb for Trump.
Conservative,"Of course she is, she wants to destroy conservatives, open the borders, double down on Obama's policies, appoint liberal justices, import refugees and use the IRS, Justice Department and FBI to target her opponents.

However, reality and greed I've seen within existing unions makes me think the ideal outcome is not really possible.

Conservative,"&gt;  **Article:**  A record number of American public-school teachers have walked off the job over the past two years—and now another strike looms in Chicago. Chief among the teachers’ demands is higher pay. They’re often right—teacher pay is too low—but for the wrong reasons.  Teachers and their unions typically attribute low salaries to flat or falling state spending on education, with skinflint politicians to blame. But in most places education spending is rising. It isn’t showing up in teachers’ paychecks because so much of it gets diverted to pay for expensive retirement benefits for former teachers. Politicians’ overly generous past promises, sometimes made at the behest of teachers unions, are now coming back to bite the education sector.  The Chicago Public Schools have a pension shortfall of $11 billion. Retirement costs devour more than 25% of the money the system receives from the state. Such costly benefits constrain it and other school systems from offering higher salaries to teachers, increasing support staff, and reducing class sizes. This is the under-the-radar driver of teacher protests in Arizona, West Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Colorado and North Carolina and cities such as Los Angeles and Denver.  For years, states and school districts didn’t save enough money to cover the retirement promises they made to teachers. Now the bills are coming due. They have to be paid; strong contractual protections mean that outside of bankruptcy it is legally impossible to reduce these pensions. It is also morally difficult to cut retiree medical coverage for midcareer employees who have been planning on receiving it.  Today nearly 90% of teachers participate in defined-benefit pension plans. According to a report by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a Washington-based nonprofit, these plans have total estimated unfunded liabilities of more than $500 billion. Consequently most employer contributions aren’t saved for future retirees but used to pay off debt. In Arizona 82.7% of the employer contributions to the teacher pension system goes to paying off unfunded liabilities. Chad Alderman of Bellwethers Education Partners, an education policy group, estimates that West Virginia teachers forgo compensation equivalent to more than 20% of their salaries to pay down pension debt.  The cost of providing health insurance for retired teachers has also been rising. By 2016 states and localities were on the hook for about $231 billion in unfunded nonpension benefit liabilities for teachers and other public-education employees. Because the Los Angeles Unified School District covers retirees, its high health-care costs—$2,300 of the $16,000 it spends per pupil—prevent it from offering teachers even higher salaries.  Although America’s public education systems have accumulated huge debts to finance expensive benefits, only the few teachers who spend their entire careers in a single state or school district will earn full benefits. In many places, it takes 20 years or more of service to qualify for health coverage in retirement and 25 to 30 years to receive a full pension. Meanwhile, 4 of 5 teachers will leave the state or district before earning complete benefits.  Unlike the 401(k) plans that prevail in the private sector, public pensions and retiree health care aren’t portable. Some 75% of teachers are shortchanged because they quit teaching or change districts before vesting or leave when their contributions are still greater than the payout for which they are eligible. The teachers, including most of the younger ones, subsidize the lifers.  These trends belie the argument that “good benefits” are what attracts and retains good teachers. When only 20% of teachers stay in the state or district that provides their retirement benefits for their entire careers, those benefits are hardly sticky. Offering generous retiree health-care coverage may even encourage teachers who qualify to retire early, depriving schools of experienced instructors.  Most teachers today are mobile, and compensation systems should change to reflect that. States should leave the traditional defined-benefit pensions behind and move toward portable defined-contribution plans. That way, teachers who move will accumulate retirement savings and states will begin to reduce their liability. And more of the money in state education spending needs to show up in the paychecks of working teachers.  States could offer teachers a deal: We’ll raise your salary if you switch to a defined-contribution pension plan. Governments would reduce their long-term pension liabilities and teachers unions could claim credit for winning salary increases. States in the South and Southwest, with Republican governments and weaker teachers unions, are well positioned to lead the reform effort.  School districts and states have little choice but to reform. Teacher retirement systems are at the heart of the budget crunch that increasingly leaves teachers, parents, communities and students unsatisfied.  *Mr. DiSalvo is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and a professor of political science at the City College of New York-CUNY.*"

Conservative,"I believe that you are being deliberately obtuse in an attempt to find anything to tar Captain Khan's family with. I will state firmly and unequivocally that I believe that Islam has nothing to do with terrorism supposedly enacted in its name. Just as Christianity has nothing to do with either the IRA or abortion clinic bombers. And let's remember that there is plenty within the Bible that we either purposefully ignore or lessen. Earlier today, hundreds of Muslims throughout France and Italy [went](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/muslims-go-catholic-mass-across-france-italy-show-solidarity-n620521) to mass to show solidarity with Catholics in the wake of the terrorist attack. Those individuals are Muslim in ways that ISIS and other so-called Islamic terror groups don't even come close to emulating.   As a Lutheran, I would never associate the WBC, KKK, IRA, or other ""Christian"" extremists with Christianity. I do not fault Muslims from making the same call in regards to ""Islamist"" terrorism. I'd rather they completely and utterly repudiate the terrorist ideologies expressed by groups, like ISIS, just as Khizr and Ghazala Khan are doing. "
Conservative,I understand his base of support is a cult of personality that likes being lied to... You don't have to tell me!
Conservative,"Only a fraction of the students who take AP History take AP Government. This is the last exposure that most of these students are going to get to American History, and it's being spend on victimology. If you were to survey students who undergo through this course, you would think the purpose of studying history is to ""correct for the past"" instead of understand the nature of the country. As a side note, the AP US government curriculum is a joke as well. The declaration of independence is not covered, nor are the founders. The constitution is not given the historical analysis necessary to interpret it correctly. Instead, students simply read it through their contemporary perspective, and gain on understanding of it."
Conservative,I was a mod.   Yes it was reported to the admins. 
Republican,"Boy did Trump troll the media, surprised our troops in Afghanistan for Thanksgiving."
Conservative,"That is probably correct, but if you ignore it, look what happens. You have the majority of people at a conservative subreddit down voting a conservative issue.  It is a sellout of the conservative movement."
Republican,"I'll freely admit that unions were necessary when they were first created in the US.  That is no longer the case, as the things the unions were created to address have since been taken care of by Federal and state labor laws.  At present, the unions are mob-run political organizations, that act against the employers, and slavishly support a Democratic Party that takes their support for granted even as it works against their interests.  Public sector unions are particularly egregious as the employer whose interests they work against is the American public."
Conservative,Donna Brazile is a Democratic Super Delegate.  She's about as close to insider politics as you can get.    This situation is no different than other networks using former Clinton or Obama staffers.  They do it for a reason.  The only difference here is the emails forced the network to act.

Conservative,"I respect you for taking the time to debate Natetendo, and the other Trump supporters in this thread. Seriously, it takes some incredible patience to deal with willfully ignorant conspiracy theorists, even though many of us have tried... Repeatedly. It's truly unfortunate that /r/conservative has become the glorified shit-shoveling show you see today, filled with tabloid articles about Hillary's health, or whatever the flavor of the week is... It's like Infowars on crack.  Any semblance of sanity is now void from this sub and, yet, morbid curiosity makes it challenging to look away from the meltdown. Perhaps it's just difficult to comprehend how fellow conservatives could become the very thing they claim to be against.  What a damn shame American politics is becoming."

In the SEO (search engine optimization) world, it's long been known that the Google instant results are the currently most-searched for terms.  It's also highly likely that at Google, only a small team of people is actually in control of filtering instant search results. All it would take is one mid level manager who wants to help Hillary and boom, you have filtered results in Google throughout the entire country.

Conservative,"Are you a bot that only speaks in talking points?   Their son, a Muslim, died defending his country. Donald Trump advocated banning all Muslims from entering the country, so they made a (somewhat misguided) speech condemning him. Then after the father made the speech, Trump proceeded to completely fabricate an idea about the wife not being allowed to speak, then claimed his running a business was sacrificing for his country.  Is this the brilliant new way to take on liberals you're talking about? Make up lies about people you disagree with and then belittle the sacrifices of military families?"
Conservative,"There's no real alternative because of a) how broad Reddit's scope is (i.e. literally infinite), b) how large Reddit's userbase is compared to almost anything else out there, and c) the few things that have a comparatively large (however remotely) userbase are toxic waste dumps like Voat or 4chan.    I use Reddit for a lot more than political stuff, so I'll stay on Reddit, but I do wish that there was an alternative with apolitical leadership.  "

Conservative,"The irony is that Comey has actually tried to protect Clinton.  The first ""investigation"" was a sham.  He most likely decided to send the letter on Friday to prevent the 650k emails from being leaked.

Comey's actions insure that this isn't leaked before the election and she still has a fighting chance to win.  "

democrats,"Sure I also checked her voting record as well as her sponsored bills. Her sponsored bills were fairly left leaning in nature. Her voting record seemed decidedly non-partisan. I only saw a couple in which she voted for a bill with a majority republican yay or nay.   It seemed she wasn't afraid to vote against what a majority Democrat decided was right. But then I could see her beliefs were consistent throughout her career which is something to be celebrated. We shouldn't immediately condemn a Democrat who is willing to work with and sometimes even agree with Republicans and then claim defection and conspiracy. That is a narrow minded and frankly childish way to view the job of a legislator.   Sure she isn't the most progressive candidate out there but that doesn't mean she isn't left leaning in her beliefs and values. She is just strong on what she believes in even if it is different than her party's majority. She is no super progressive like Bernie, but that shouldn't mean she isn't democratic."

As for these ‘asylum seekers’, 80% of them are found to not have credible asylum claims and are denied. Of course anyone that wants to come to the US for any reason would say they are seeking asylum because they think it’s their best chance at getting to stay. They bring children with them that often are not even theirs and they have to get DNA tests.   Mexico offered the migrant caravans food, shelter, medical care, and jobs under the “you are at home plan” and they said no.

It didn't prevent them from studying gun violence - though that isn't in any way connected with their mandate - it just prohibited them from advocating for gun control - which they had been doing.  They responded to that by ceasing all studies because the entire purpose of their studying gun violence was to advocate for gun control.  Go figure.

Liberal,"A few years ago I planted some saplings - two peach, and two apple. One of the peach trees failed to survive the first winter, and the dog chewed the other in half. The apple trees have been doing fine, though, and actually produced fruit for the first time this summer. Losing the peach trees was disappointing, but really I was only out $30 and a year's worth of growth had I decided to replace them. If something were to happen to one of my apple trees now, I would be far more upset.  Similarly, you can't compare the potential of a fetus to the actions of an infant, let alone a grown adult. Someone who has ""borne fruit"" can't be compared to a fetus that may or may not someday do the same. A sapling is not the same as a fully mature tree, and while there's nothing inherently wrong with valuing the potential of the former, it's disingenuous to pretend they have the same value."

We are not advocating breaking up private ceremonies and sending the cops to stop anyone from doing something, that's the left.  You never asked me to explain how it affects me, so how can I still not have?  It has nothing to do with side effects. Policies are not made by not having negative effects(which I do think Gay Marriage has negative cultural effects).

Republican,"Northern Democrats. A greater percentage of Republicans supported it, and there was a North/South Dem divide.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964#By_party  The larger point I agree with - the bill was decidedly bi-partisan.  I wish one of its co-authors and greatest proponents - [Everett Dirksen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everett_Dirksen) - was more of a figure of importance and pride among the average Republican today - he was a serious budget hawk and skeptical of big government but also a big believer in compromise and cooperation and [evolved on his ideas](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-06-28/site/ct-everett-dirksen-flashback-0629-20140628_1_civil-rights-act-everett-dirksen-engle) (!) to become an advocate for for civil rights equality.

Conservative,So you are saying that because the news said he didn't have as much money as claimed he should now not put his money in a blind trust because the news says he should? Am I missing something. Does no one actually care about the conflict of interest? The news first said this now they say this so I don't care that Trump's businesses are tied up in countries that could influence his decisions as president. Seems like a weird stance to me.

Conservative,Nice opinion. Missing the independent research and facts though.
Republican,"&gt;It’s possible to support Trump to stop Hillary and still call out his problems and lies  Sigh. Trump is just as horrible if not more so than Clinton. If you're supporting him, you've already, at least tacitly, approved of him. That approval diminishes your capacity to call him out on anything.  At some point, people have to realize that you can take a stand and not have to do mental gymnastics to justify your horrible candidate choices. Until more people do, we'll only have terrible binary choices like Trump and Clinton.  McMullin made a similar point on a Sunday show recently when asked something like why he was running when he had no chance of winning. As long as that attitude prevails, we'll keep seeing articles like these."

Conservative,"I'll bite. Not down voting either.  I do think we should be making reasoned decisions based on evidence when possible. This is not possible all the time since the very nature of science is slow. I tend to stray away from principled/rhetoric driven decision making as it is prone to bias that causes irrational decision making that is more liable to lead to poor outcomes.  Should we be governed by the intellectual elite? No. Should our elected officials make rational decisions that are supported by data when possible? Yes. Can the political parties in the US do a better job of that? Yes. Will that likely happen? No. The same reason I do not support assault rifle bans is the same reason why I support intervention/response to anthropogenic warming; it's where the data leads us. (I know I'll get flak in here by people who disagree on matters of global warming.)  While I disagree with Neil in that all of our choices should or could be self evident and that everything is clear cut, I do think reasonable, evidence driven thinking should be the primary influence in federal and state level decision making. Sadly, that is not the case and I don't see either party as being willing to honestly present data and argument.  Do you agree or disagree with the notion that rational decision making based off of honest analysis of data will lead to more positive outcomes than other forms of decision making? Why or why not? "

They've brigaded against more than him as well, much more, and against reddit itself. They've ruined and attempted to ruins people's livelihoods because they can't handle descenting opinions. Nothing done. Fuck /u/spez and the rest of reddit for their double standards and hypocrisy. And fuck the power mods too."

democrats,"I mean, I hate that people now think bias=fake.    Rachel Maddow is one of the most biased news reporters out there. She's a dyed in the wool liberal progressive lesbian.    But she's also a best-selling author of military history, a Rhodes scholar, and a fucking brilliant journalist. She fully admits she sees thing from a liberal perspective, but that doesn't mean she lies or omits things or won't report on negative things liberals do too. You should have seen her cover Rod Blagoyavich, it was brutal.    Same with conservatives I disagree with vehemently like Bill Cristol and Andrew Sullivan. I may think they're obnoxious quite frequently because of partisan differences, but I trusted them not to just lie to my face to further their narrative. They too come at things from their own perspective, but they don't pretend like you get to choose the reality, and when you talk to them, you basically are disagreeing based on the same set of facts. Plenty of conservatives are like this, even though they're getting shoved out more and more by the alt-right and Trump supporters (and had already been purged extensively by the ""tea party"" movement).    There's a reason Fox went with ""Fair and Balanced"" over ""Journalistic Integrity."" Because you can be misleading, you can give equal time to a side that sometimes has no merit to their argument, and even choosing stories is sometimes unfair when more important stories matter.    I wish people would give journalism just the tiniest ounce of respect.    People actually thought that 99.9999% of Newspaper endorsements NOT going for one of the two major candidates (something un-fucking-precedented) was a GOOD thing.    It wasn't.  "

Conservative,"Under that train of thought, we should abolish all rights awarded to traditional marriage. There is no reason to award these type of marriage licenses to heterosexual couples. At a spiritual level, it is a bond between both individuals. The document is just a priced of paper by the governments. You can't give legal rights to one type of couple,and then you deny those rights to another.  Also, there are no credible scientific research   suggesting actual negative cultural affects revolving around homosexual couples. The only actual research suggest the presence of two parents provide a better atmosphere for a child. Regardless of the orientation of said couple."
Conservative,LOL.  Only took them 30 minutes.  We had someone trapped for three hours in my building.  Trump's a wimp. 
Conservative,One thing that they could have done would be to collect them and put them neatly on a table before storing them for transport.  It's not like they couldn't re-use them what with this being an election year and lots of rallies to get a little more use out of them.  Even if you don't hold with the normal flag ceremony stuff there's no reason to just leave them piled on the floor like that.
Conservative,"So you are an immoral person, got it."
Conservative,"Sure! Last January I had an experience I couldn't deny where I knew God was ""speaking"" to me. Not a voice like if you and I were to have a conversation, more so knowledge flooding my heart. Since then there's been plenty of affirmation beyond what can be explained. That's the very, very short version."
Conservative,"Thanks for taking the time to read my comment. I appreciate your take on it. I've addressed some of the things you brought up below, but I did go a little out of order for the sake of flow.  &gt;The issue is the inability for the liberals to actually work with the conservatives - their nationwide planning *must* be the precedent in all states, counties, towns etc. No letting the local places decide if it works out for them or not, it *must* happen everywhere or it doesn't happen at all.   Since this was ultimately your conclusion I wanted to put it first. I don't think this is an immovable wall towards the system I described. Liberalism, like Conservatism is a philosophy that is implemented in so many different ways by so many different people. Living out the philosophy may cause some stereotypical behaviors, but I don't think there's a reason to believe either philosophy guarantees the practitioner be an intractable negotiator. So I have to believe that even if there's no discussion now, there can be discussion. To the side of that, I personally feel like having a philosophical balance and utilizing each ""sides"" strengths is a noble thing to strive for especially in times of adversity. [Teddy Roosevelt](http://www.npr.org/2012/05/14/152684575/teddy-roosevelts-shocking-dinner-with-washington) ultimately made the decision to invite a former slave to the White House for dinner because Roosevelt felt the slightest hesitation in inviting him in the first place. He was ashamed of himself. I respect that. I just don't want my emotions to dictate my goals earned through thought and introspection. And I have found a lot of some degree of mental comfort in trying that, so I guess I feel comfortable in using that experience to make these suggestions.  &gt;is actually more of a Libertarian idea  Good eye. I do usually identify with more Libertarian ideas than others.  &gt;I was looking at the consequences of the businesses  This is a point that we actually disagree on a pretty fundamental level but I'm not giving up on finding that common ground though. It's where I leave most Libertarians as well. I have come to believe that companies should work in the interest of their communities first, then their shareholders. More in the regulatory sense than taxation. But I don't imagine I'll be changing your mind on that any time soon, though I'd be happy to discuss that. However, I can tell you that there are many pro-business ideas I still hold.   &gt;The response was a resounding, ""You shouldn't give a fuck about that, other countries have it, it's stupid the US doesn't"" and that cemented my answer on that issue to, ""No, it shouldn't be mandatory.""   I'm not trying to be all ""psychiatrist""-y, but am I reading correctly here that at least some of your apprehension to see it from their side stems from their unwillingness to have a dialogue? I mean, as opposed to purely ideological differences."

Most folks who support gay marriage aren't actually gay married.) there may be pro-gun voters that may not actually own guns or care if restrictions are put on assault weapons. "

Without Utah's 6 electoral votes, Trump has a much harder road map to the 270 EV's needed to win. "
Republican,"That is a genuinely great question.  I hadn't heard of Surkov before (is that bad?), but I read a few articles about him, and his case it's definitely psychological abuse.  Whether or not it's gaslighting is probably semantics at that point.  The difference between Russian propagandists and flip-flopping politicians in the U.S. is the control they have over the populace.  From what I read, Surkov uses his power not just to lie, but to intimidate and silence opposition until his surrogates are the only audible voices.  Restricting the press' freedom in this way is a deliberate attempt to control how people think *by removing their agency.*  With Trump/Clinton, love them or hate them, people were pretty free in this country to make up their minds.  All the info was freely available and just a few keystrokes away.  People reading just Trump's twitter, or just MotherJones, are pigeonholing themselves into a worldview, not being forced into it.  If Trump somehow dismantled the media, then established his White House as the only available source of information, I would be singing a different tune."

Liberal,"Well if you honestly believe that, then I can't help you. That is such a ridiculous thing to say that it doesn't even warrant a serious reply. It doesn't even sound like you know what despot means."
Conservative,"To be fair this is the only real way gun control would actually work. No guns allowed in the country period. The fundamental problem with the gun control laws (common sense, reasonable, whatever buzz word they want use) is it makes it harder for responsible people to own guns, but has zero effect on those who shouldn't have them. If the priority is to stop gun violence from criminals or unstable people who get their hands on them; a universal ban is the only real solution.  That being said it is entirely unconstitutional, and should absolutely not be enacted. The whole gun control discussion should shift to the all or nothing standpoint. The only way gun control advocates can achieve the goals they want is that solution. It's one of the things America needs to decide on. Is gun ownership worth the occasional incident? I say yes."

Conservative,"Bear with me, I want to understand where you’re coming from. What specifics are you pointing to about pre and post US California?   I’m not terrible sure what your point about selling it to Mexico is? Who’s going to pay for it? Mexico? Because as was stated in the thread, California’s gdp is larger than Mexico’s. We’d be gifting it to the Mexicans.   Along with our naval base in San Diego, Camp Pendleton, China Lake, the Marine base in the Mojave (forgot the name, but it’s east of Barstow), would America be cool with handing over military assets?   Not to mention, there are plenty of proud American constitutionalists (pro 2A, bill of rights, etc) in California. I’ve worked with a ton of them from Hemet, San Bernardino, Riverside, Bakersfield, Sacramento, etc. I don’t think they’d appreciate a Cal Exit."
Conservative,"This is what gets me.  McMullin has zero repeat zero chance to win (the wild-eyed moonshot idea that maybe the election can be thrown to the House is exactly that, a wild-eyed moonshot idea), so his only purpose in this election is to deny Trump electoral votes.  Pretending otherwise is delusional.    I have been cast in the uncomfortable role of disliking someone who is (by his statements) a strong conservative with good ideas.  I hope that he loses Utah to Trump, but by a small enough margin that a message is still sent.  "

Conservative,"Oh I completely agree but that is a different question than what Cruz asked.  They way Cruz asked it left no choice but for ICANN to answer it won't be held to the first amendment.  Frankly it almost sounds like a trick question used to generate a quick soundbite that cuts off any real answer/discussion.  The much more important discussion occurs after that soundbite   and we should be a lot more interested in that, of course the linked video doesn't seem to give a shit about that and cuts off as soon as the initial question is answered and patronizingly says ""That is all that many Americans need to know""."

Conservative,"Actually that is incorrect there is evidence that two biological parents married is the greatest predictor of health well adapted children. I can provide tons of references if you wish.  Traditional Marriage actually has a benefit to the state(namely the production of children), while gay marriage does not. It is essentially legalized friendship. But I would most definitely prefer the rights of both to be done away with than to try and argue some kind of equal protection which doesn't have any weight. "

Conservative,"Lol, i don't think CNN is fair, they are very biased just like other liberal media.  Just because they have republicans on there panel doesn't mean they aren't biased. Also you have to take note that Fox is a conservative network and MSNBC  a liberal one, CNN is supposed to be near, so it is understandable when the others have there bias.  Well first of all, the lack of reporting regarding wikileaks, the segments about pepe and how the meme is a symbol of ""white supremacists"", the insane amount of time dedicated to Trump accusers who had no police reports or active cases in court, and so on.   Then there is their attitude towards black lives matter, and there suggestions that Trump is the cause of all of the violence at his rallies and of the the violence against his supporters.   CNN is clearly part of the liberal propaganda machine, just because they have panels with conservatives like all news networks should doesn't mean they aren't. "

Conservative,... any sub they don't like!
Conservative,"My take is the Dems painted themselves into a corner.  Backfire.  Big time.  They're damned if they impeach, damned if they don't.  I think President Trump wins either way.  If they're so stupid that this goes to the Senate, imo they're toast.   I'm thinking they may vote to censure and avoid the Senate altogether.  But at this point, nothing surprises me...their stupidity knows no bounds.  Hence, Nadler is saying Russian collusion will be included in impeachment.   Yeah, the same Russian collusion that was NOT proven, and the Mueller hearings were a dud.  lmfao  In the meantime, important bipartisan legislation that will help the American people has been sitting on Pelosi's desk for months because they're all so busy trying to find something to nail President Trump.  The longer this charade goes on, the higher the probability of it backfiring."
Conservative,Thanks. This is probably the best explanation I have heard so far. This makes it a lot more clear. I think my issues lie mostly with the way ISPs are structured in the US and the monopoly that is created when you have no choice of ISP and they are also transit and content providers.

democrats,"&gt;not infringing on their rights?  There is no infringement. You don't have a right to own any weapon you want without restriction.

If Congress passes reasonable firearm restrictions, like requiring ownership standards, the Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized such legislative actions as reasonable restrictions that are constitutional.

Trump doesn't want to dismantle NATO, he wants them to refocus their efforts on Islamic terrorism and pay what they are legally obligated to pay, which about 3(?) other NATO countries are actually doing.

democrats,"&gt;When did respecting due process become too radical for Democrats?  Due process? Do you even understand what that phrase means? Or are you just parroting phrases you read in some NRA fear mail?  You do not have the right to own certain firearms. For instance, you can't own a machine gun. It's against the law. Prohibiting ownership of such weapons is constitutional. There is no denial of due process in that prohibition since there is no right to begin with. The same is true for other lawful, reasonable restrictions on firearm ownership.  You don't have the constitutional right to own any weapon you want without any limitations or restrictions. Read the Second Amendment *stare decisis*. The Supreme Court has long recognized that reasonable limitations on firearm ownership are constitutional, and the constitution grants the Supreme Court the power to decide that."

Conservative,"Imagine a legal system in which hearing about wrong-doing were evidence of wrong-doing. Let that play out in your mind. Do you see why we don't allow hearsay evidence?  Were we to extend whistleblower protections to everyone--including those with second- or third-hand knowledge of events--what we're really doing is inviting a flood of anonymous allegations, supported by other anonymous sources. Do you see how it would be very easy for politically motivated individuals to use this to create the illusion of corruption where none exists, while being protected from ever having to go on the record themselves? Do you believe that would be good for the country? We live in an era of flash mobs and coordinated media attacks. It would be entirely too easy to organize something like this. Regardless of who is doing it, or to whom, it would be a disaster.  I remind you of what Senator Reid did on the Senate floor. [""The word's out that he [Romney] hasn't paid taxes in 10 years.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VOIFRH0Zgs). The purpose of this accusation--without evidence--was to compel Romney to waive his own 4th amendment rights (or to compel a government agency to violate them). This illustrates the danger in this kind of accusation. There is simply no way to disprove such an allegation without allowing scrutiny of the records. And because Reid did it on the floor of the Senate, he was protected from legal repercussions. He was able to make that allegation but no one was able to press him on who exactly made the claim and whether they had any actual evidence that of this supposed crime. It was a smear job, flat out.  (As an aside: If you really believe that you have nothing to hide, then I advise you to never, ever say a word to the police. You will quickly find out that you have plenty to hide. And in our contemporary cancel culture, where spin and public perception are more weaponized than they have ever been, your 4th amendment rights are more important, and harder to protect, than ever before.)  You may wish to argue that POTUS has no 4th amendment rights when it comes to his diplomacy. That's a good point. Here we get to the importance of state secrets. I want to push back on the idea that ""there's nothing to hide."" Information is classified for a reason. There may very well be reasons to hide information--and those reasons have nothing to do with criminal activity. To say that everything the President does should be a matter of public record jeopardizes our national security AND the lives of our agents across the globe (which is why, incidentally, Clinton's improper storage of emails did in fact compromise our national security and why she should have been indicted).  In sum, it matters. If you care about your rights, it matters. If you care about having a functioning government, it matters. If you care about the US being able to have functional diplomatic relations with world leaders, it matters."

democrats,"Right.  Because unicorns.    Look, your concerns aren't wrong.  Business as usual is obviously not the answer.  But you saw what happened with the republican party this year.  What kind of candidate can run as a republican for office now that that party is fully engaged in post-fact thinking?  It's no longer about looking at real information and making educated decisions or policy choices anymore.  So what can democrats do when the country is gerrymandered to favor post-fact candidates?  Go to the lowest common denominator?  Be dumb and dumber for votes?"

Conservative,"That's a big part of it, and there's nothing wrong with that.  Is he supposed to not learn as he goes?  Just dig his heals in and stand firm no matter what?  No, a leader should consider information as it is acquired, and use good judgement with what he learns.  The other part I don't hear mentioned is that a Primary campaign is different than a General Election campaign.  It has always been that way, and both sides adhere to it.  That Donald Trump happens to do it too, and in an effective way, seems to baffle some people for some reason."

Conservative,"In one of these clips there, he speaks about the income inequality issue that goes thrown around a lot. Last year, he had a segment on his podcast that went over this in depth, explaining exactly how insane the whole income inequality argument is. That was the segment that first got me hooked on him in the first place. Really fantastic piece.  **Edit:**  One thing that's important to remember is that as fantastic as Shapiro is and as much as many of us love his work, we have to remember that this is not about him, but rather, about *his ideas*. The most frightening thing in politics is seeing people deify someone and turn them into a strongman. Whether that's Obama, Hillary, Trump, or countless others, it's human nature to want to portray some public figure as a saviour and line up behind that person. That's what leads to totalitarianism and that's the polar opposite of everything that conservatism is all about.  My point is that there are a lot of huge fans of Shapiro on this board (myself included) but we have to remember that it's not about him; it's about the ideas he's promoting. He's simply a guy who does a great job at explaining and promoting these values and ideas. But we have to remember that it's about the ideas, not about the individual. Don't treat Shapiro (or anyone else) like the left treats Obama. We can't fall into the same trap that the left so often falls into."

Conservative,"HB 1888 which passed earlier this year.  Issue - some voting areas are moving mobile voting locations from one place to another to another etc during the entirety of early voting. This gives the appearance of favoring certain voter blocks over others.  Summary - Background and Purpose   ""It has been suggested that while the flexibility for election authorities to place and move polling  stations during an early voting period was designed to accommodate more voters closer to their  homes or workplaces, concerns have been raised about the possibility that some authorities  accommodate certain voting populations to the exclusion of others. H.B. 1888 seeks to address  this issue by revising the temporary branch polling place hours of operation.""  Analysis  ""H.B. 1888 repeals Election Code provisions restricting the days and hours for early voting by  personal appearance at a temporary branch polling place based on county population and amends  the Election Code to revise the days and hours for early voting by personal appearance at a  temporary branch polling place by requiring the voting to be conducted on the days that voting is  required to be conducted at the main early voting polling place and to remain open for at least  eight hours each day or three hours each day if the city or county clerk does not serve as the  early voting clerk for the territory holding the election and the territory has fewer than 1,000  registered voters. The bill clarifies that a movable temporary branch polling place is a polling  place located in a movable structure. The bill limits the elections for which certain political  subdivisions are required to use the regular county election precincts to an election held on the  November uniform election date.""  Supporters Statement  ""HB 1888 would require temporary branch polling places to remain open at  set locations throughout the early voting period, which would prevent  election officials from using temporary branch polling places to target  certain populations on certain days or at specific times to the exclusion of  others. In requiring these polling places to remain open at a single location  throughout early voting, the bill also would increase the polling places'  accessibility to voters and encourage the maximum number of voters to  participate in the election.""  Opponents Statement   ""HB 1888 would prohibit legitimate uses of mobile voting that allowed rural populations, senior citizens, and others to vote easily. Temporary  branch polling places allow for convenient voting in remote parts of rural  counties, senior citizen communities, and other areas. They are often kept  open only for a portion of the early voting period, then closed once there  is no longer demand to vote. HB 1888 would require temporary branch  polling places to remain open throughout the early voting period, even  when it did not make financial sense to do so. This could lead to certain  temporary branch polling places not being opened at all, which could  make voting more difficult for some populations.""  My own editorial note: opponent argument does not address the issue of mobile voting sites being moved from place to place during early voting. There is an opportunity for abuse here in that a the sites chosen for mobile voting as a given site moves from place to place may unfairly favor specific ethnic, economic, or political groups.  The left is suing TX claiming HB 1888 unfairly targets student voting at campus locations."
Conservative,"&gt; Many of you are aware of my attempt to troll the trolls last week. I honestly thought I might find some common ground with that community by meeting them on their level.

Republican,"I don't know about that Mr. Will. We have a two party system so there are many factions within each party. In a two party system like this parties change radically over time. Trump's popularity seems to me like a populist surge. A continuation of the anti establishment Ron Paul/Tea Party movements, but in a slightly different form. I think his base demagoguery allows him to easily appeal to a lot of people. McCain and Romney were moderate candidates and they lost so I think Trump is also a reaction to that. I fully expect Trump to get absolutely destroyed on election day though so I don't think his brand will continue much beyond this election. "
Conservative,Lol it truly is a knee-jerk reflex for them
Conservative,Again I just gave an example of the commander of a major war lying to the secretary to the defense  I hate having to stand up for the Obama administration but from experience in life what most would see as an evil scheme I chalk up to incompetence.

Romney's percentage of people who said they voted for him was like half the amount of people who actually voted for him. People want to be associated with the winner, because people in general are quivering weaklings who only care about being accepted by other losers and who run at the sight of their own shadow."
democrats,"Conspiracy theorists fail the common sense test when they set their hair on fire about this meeting.  If Bill Clinton wanted an off-the-books sub rosa meeting with the AG about the email investigation, he certainly wouldn't do it in a meeting that was known to the public. It wouldn't be on both of their publicly available calendars.  Bill Clinton has known the AG for many years. He nominated her for a US Attorney slot in 1993. They are old friends. This was two friends meeting. "

Conservative,"I don't really get it. Trump was my least favorite republican candidate due to his outbursts and personal history. However, policy wise, I agree with him far more than anyone else this election. No matter how much this sub doesn't like Trump, there's just no way a conservative could agree more with Clinton. If you took all of the major issues this sub supported and did the opposite, you would be almost 100% in line with Hillary. There's just not a logical reason that a conservative would not vote for Trump this November. "
Republican,"&gt; I hadn't heard of Surkov before (is that bad?)  No but I think you should definitely check out Hypernormalisation by Adam Curtis if you have a way of doing so.

Conservative,"Trump will win Utah, though if he doesn't the House gives it to him anyway so it's totally irrelevant."
Conservative,"Let me reiterate Johnny's point, since you didn't seem to get it.    It is a survival tactic.  If you want to have someone who is even remotely conservative elected, you need to win general elections.  Period dot end of the argument.  It's fine and dandy to be a principled loser, but if you go down with the ship then don't expect to have any say in what comes after.    In this election in particular, with the individual opposite Trump as starkly bad as she is, I cannot fathom why you are agitating for Trump to do something - anything - to lessen his chances.  This is particularly important given that he might actually be a candidate who can move the dial in hitherto Democrat states.  If he can steal electoral votes from Hillary then *we need that*.    The culture war is over.  Social conservatives lost on every battle that mattered.  Abortion, drugs, gay marriage, etc.  We lost, and now we need to pick ourselves up and focus on issues that matter to the electorate.  Once in office a conservative can leverage the bureaucracy and the power of the executive branch to push a social conservative agenda, but *you have to get elected first*.  And the way to do that isn't by pushing social conservatism during the general."

So why is it that you Libertarians think that this is the time to come and lecture Republicans about how we need to change our party?  And I know what's likely to happen.  This comment will be downvoted by the Libertarians who are here that are on the hunt for Republicans to vote for Johnson/Weld because we are not satisfied with Trump.  It hasn't really been a secret that you folks are seizing on this opportunity as a chance to get your party some national attention.  I don't blame you ... but let's not pretend that Libertarians are really going to welcome diverse Republicans into the Libertarian party and be willing to consider OUR views and OUR beliefs and incorporate THOSE into YOUR platform.  You just want us to vote Johnson/Weld... so you are playing some of the more extreme ideas of Libertarianism very close to the vest right now.  What THIS movement likely means is a return to Constitutional conservatism and a rejection of Trump's statist and nationalistic rhetoric.      "

Conservative,"This is the best possible outcome in an election where both parties ran a socialist candidate. Clinton will win and the FBI investigation will progress until she's forced to resign. Until that happens republicans will have the political capital to block every bill and every appointment. Kaine will become president, won't be able to get anything done, will be the obligatory nominee in 2020 and get clobbered by whoever the republicans run. Having lost in 2016 the nutjob wing of the party will have been swept away and we'll get a genuine conservative candidate with an easy path to the White House.   Neither is on the ballot and its name is Clinton. "
Conservative,"You're the one who equates different average levels of intelligence with superiority. And I don't think white people have the highest average intelligence. That would go to Ashkenazi Jews with an average of 115, then East Asians with an average of 105. Whites are different than other races, and the science is in. Racial egalitarianism has been thoroughly debunked.  And that meaning isn't particularly straightforward. I've seen the phrase used to mean multiple different things from the meaning you give to a desire for political dominance over other races. I also don't need to ""justify"" a belief in human bio-diversity. Scientific studies have done enough to prove it for me."

Yes maybe Trump isn't as conservative as I'd like, but he's our only shot to defeat Hillary.  We can work against policies we disagree with after he's president.  The alternative to supporting him is Clinton and an irreparably ""progressive"" Supreme court.  Trump's list for potential judges alone is more than enough reason to support him."

democrats,"&gt; So what can democrats do when the country is gerrymandered to favor post-fact candidates?  There are a few policies the Democrats support which are hugely unpopular, and which Hillary refused to repudiate, because she was in the unfortunate position of serving two masters.  Turning away from big business and the military, and paying more attention to the needs of the electorate, is the obvious way to gain more votes, and more credibility.  Hillary thought she'd be elected despite falling short in this respect, and Hillary was shown to be wrong.  Everyone whose opinion I respect on reddit thought that this election failure would be a signal for the Democratic party to get its act together, and become more focused on the issues that concern the electorate.

Conservative,"&gt; it’s pretty clear that Trump’s campaign directly benefitted from Russian meddling in the 2016 election, which should be distressing to anyone.  Just because someone in America benefited from something that someone in Russia did, doesn't mean there is a reason to be concerned; their goal was to create division.    If Russia suddenly cornered the market on certain rare minerals they could be suddenly in control of a number of industries, like cell phone production..... if they dropped the price of those minerals, the cost of cell phones would also drop.  If you own one of these cell phones, are you suddenly a Russian asset?  You have directly benefited from actions directly related to the Russian Government.  Now lets launch a 2 year investigation on it!  Oh crap, it turns out it was just Russians doing things.  That's what we have here; Russians doing nefarious crap and inevitably someone will benefit, directly or indirectly.  It could be said the Democrats are currently benefiting from the Russian Collusion delusion as we speak because they are campaigning on it, on the actions of the Russian Government.  It sounds silly, sure, but that's what happened with Trump.   The Russians created fake Facebook groups in support of Trump..... and BLM.... and Bernie Sanders......and *against* Trump and *against* Bernie and *against* BLM.  They didn't *care* who won as long as it *wasn't* Hillary.  That was their one goal; create division.  Hillary dunked her winnable election herself by campaigning like shit and disparaging a very large portion of the population with her ""Deplorables"" comment.  The way MSM and Democrats carried water for the Russians has been more damaging and aligning with their goals then the Russians could have possibly hoped for."

A Muslim kills 13 people at a US military base while shouting ""Allah Akbar""....chalk it up as workplace violence.  Muslims attack a US diplomatic compound and kill four....blame it on a Youtube video.    This tactic is losing its luster, if it hasn't already.

Conservative,"&gt;So my calling him names makes me a [SJW](http://www.quickmeme.com/img/a5/a5b1fa2e840b8b6934d42939d4f7ed6255a9d949072088b1a05be1dcc1f86d0f.jpg)?  Isn't calling me a SJW supposed to be an ad-hominem attack?  You are confirmed a SJW.  Welcome to the club.  It's alright, your boy Trump is here as well, hes got no problem calling people names; guess hes a SJW too.  I'm not the one getting all worked up like you. All over the words of one man who hasn't done anything to you. But he said mean things to people and here you are calling him scum and making references to his cock. You are  going full on SJW. You are projecting.  &gt;He's a scumbag because he either lies outright about what he's said in the past, or his memory is too shit to remember correctly.  That's a start. So Trump is scum and Hillary is a monster. It's all relative. You don't have to cry so much about it, it doesn't change the fact that Hillary is the greater evil.  &gt;Plus, he's got no problem committing [war crimes](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-reiterates-desire-to-murder-terrorists-families-a6912496.html) which I think puts him square in the scumbag section.   What do you think drone strikes do? If terrorists are going to use human shields to survive, let their first shields be their own family. You belong with liberals with their Bush is a war criminal rhetoric. I hate to break it to you, but war is hell and if it's fought it can never be won the moral or easy way. TIL that most wars waged have been waged by scum. If so, count me as scum. You were saying about racism losing its meaning, well throw scum in their. In enough time you will have to try harder to go full SJW.  &gt;I'd honestly love to hear some of your criticisms at this point.  Anything at all.  What don't you link about him?  He is a protectionist. Jobs should be sent overseas if they can be more profitable. It's called comparative advantage. Stealing jobs is rhetoric meant for low information voters.  I don't agree with his budget positions or his call for more infrastructure spending. At least not through deficit spending. There should be entitlement reform and budget cuts.   I don't think he will repeal Obamacare. I don't think he will build a wall. I don't trust that he will do half of what he claims. I suspect that he will address them somewhere in the middle. So better border enforcement, reforms to the ACA and a right leaning Supreme Court Justice.   I align with Ted Cruz and Rand Paul more than Trump on most economic issues. My main support of Trump comes from his anti globalist, anti SJW, anti establishment, pro border security and pro 2nd  amendment stances and who he stands against.  This country needs a major shakeup and the estblishment on both sides need to broken. Trump has numerous flaws but he is the only one in this race that can wield that club and beat them over the head with it. It doesn't look pretty but it's the best we have. Why the hell should I attack the only man that can defeat Hillary?  &gt;You're confused.  He is the less shitty of two shitty options.  Please explain to me how he's a champion of conservatism;  Show me how in the past hes supported conservative causes, show me his conservative policies.  Conservative support him because he's not Hillary Clinton.  He's not a conservative. And you are right. Maybe you should throw away your assumptions about me and calm the fuck down. See right now you seem calm and we have found common ground. No need to accuse me of sucking Tump's cock. I have always said he is the lesser of two evils. I just think he is far lesser evil.   &gt;Your reading comprehension is sorely lacking. Go back and read my last comment where I explicitly state that I'm voting for him.  I thought I misread you. Why the hell are you ranting and raving? Trump is frustrating but that's just the way he is. He will never change. Deal with it. This is war, no matter how shitty your general is, if you can't step up and replace them you get nowhere attacking them. That's how you lose for sure.   &gt;Besides that fact, this is where the problem lies.  Your lack of consistency.  We oppose Clinton because of her shit past and record.  Go ahead and apply that level of scrutiny to Trump's past and you'll quickly find he's not ""better.""  If anything he's just less shitty, or at least shitty on a less global scale.  That makes him better. That is what you don't seem to grasp.  &gt;There is a laundry list of things this guy says that comes back as being blatantly untrue.    Welcome to politics. I assume all politicians are liars. The honest ones lose. Well I did support Ron Paul. I saw how honesty gets you nowhere when the opposition will bury you at all costs.  &gt;Did I hurt your feelings by insulting him? LOW ENERGY!  Get over it, Trump is notorious for calling people names.  He is now confirmed a SJW.  Trump is entertaining and gives the people what they want. You are a candidate for a talk with Dr. Phil.   &gt;[I guarantee you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nALb4lEbSbA) that's not the case.  But like I said earlier, your lack of ability to scrutinize the candidates equally, puts you squarely in the liberal camp.  You will find other like minded individuals in /r/hillaryclinton .  Just replace Clinton's name with Trump and you'll get along great.  Criticism is mocked and you can circle jerk about how great your candidate is as they pull the wool over your eyes.  Fox News has rotted your brain. Life and politics are not fair and balanced. War is hell, political wars involve winning at all costs. I could be crucial of Trump on nearly every issue.  I'm just smart enough to know that attacking him aids Clinton.   "

Neither will I administer a poison to anybody when asked to do so, nor will I suggest such a course. Similarly I will not give to a woman a pessary to cause abortion.

Republican,To be fair his whole ticket was not being like other Presidents. 
Conservative,"&gt; The problem, then, isn't net neutrality, it's the geographic monopolies these providers enjoy.   Who is going to undertake the task of bringing competition in the market?  As of right now Google is the second most valuable company in the WORLD and they gave up on deploying fiber because it was such a stupidly expensive mess.    Similarly, Verizon gave up on deploying FiOS because it was so insanely expensive.  Being an ISP makes you a natural monopoly, no private company has the kind of capital or is willing to take the risk to deploy broadband to somewhere that already has it, because they risk low turnover and going out of business from the costs.   Broadband choice only works if companies are forced to share the line, and unfortunately states and municipalities are selling exclusive rights to their market just so the companies are willing to build infrastructure.    With the purchase of Time Warner by Charter, people now have less options for broadband, and this problem is only going to get worse until some company manages to make wireless work at scale.  That is why net neutrality is important.  Sure, I'm fine with getting rid of it if everyone gets 4-5 options of providers, but until then the ISPs need to be kept in line and anti-competitive measures need to be struck down. "

Conservative,"I MADE A MISTAKE IN THIS COMMENT, SEE BELOW COMMENTS;  My view is this. If the GOP wants Voter ID to be taken seriously, they need to promote a measure to concomitantly pass both Voter ID laws, AND FREE ID's for low-income households. Then we eliminate voter fraud and nobody gets to claim discrimination. And we solve another problem, which is the fact that some of these families literally are too poor to afford an ID, and since it's a CRIME not to have an ID when you're over the age of 18, we'd be literally taking an entire demographic out of the 'criminal' class.

I'll grant you the right to take your own life if you wish, but don't take another's life just because it's inconvenient to you and it's not as far along the journey.  Life and conception are a beautiful thing, once the fetus is formed the unique DNA blueprint for the life is complete and the individual human being is in their first phase of life, just like you and I once were my friend.  Women are made to love and nurture their children, not kill them.   what could be more natural and beautiful and pure in this world than a mother's love for her child .   Furthermore, if an armed assailant into a home at night, and kills a woman while she is pregnant, how many murders does he get charged with?  He get's charged for double murder, that's two lives.  The baby never gets a chance.    believe what you will, take your own life, and forfeit a funeral service, but don't speak for the speechless.

Republican,"For the EPA failing to remove the sources of contamination, you mean? The EPA doesn't pollute, it tries to catch other people polluting. And part of the reason they do so poorly is that it's very difficult to prove that a particular contaminant comes from a particular source. Scientists more often find that there is a *high likelihood* that certain environmental effects and industries are linked. This makes it easy for corporate lawyers to talk their way out of accountability.  Another huge problem is funding, and, of course, laws that discourage or [actively ban citizen science](https://www.datainnovation.org/2016/01/why-did-wyoming-make-citizen-science-illegal/).  **TL;DR: The EPA isn't criminally negligent, just fighting a very uphill battle.**"

No solution is going to make everyone happy, the best you can do is try, and currently, the culture california spreads across the nation is dragging everyone down with that sinking ship.

And Trump stands up to a mass media which is obviously against Republicans, when other Republican candidates have kept trying to appease them. Too many Republican candidates have been weak-kneed, not to mention just plain terrible at getting their message across. Trump is either an example that Republican voters respect strong-willed candidates who aren't afraid to speak their mind, or an example that the public is perfectly willing to vote for a TV game-show host.

At least 1000 additional external jobs in the community will also be saved from their wages, and not to mention the lack of unemployment for upwards of 90 weeks that the feds would have had to pay (state taxpayer loss of $95M roughly)  Overall the deal resulted in a net loss to Carrier of at least $500M per decade.  Also seems Trump pressured Carrier to relocate many of these employees within the US to other branches/factories that are being displaced. Resulting in few net jobs lost. Unclear how much that will cost, but a lot more than likely.  Seems that every liberal wants these people to be jobless, and on the government dole, and are willing for Carrier to accept an additional $500M in profitability (net) just to score a tiny political point against Trump.

Conservative,"But you are free to to criticize them for those decisions - this is about pointing out the blatant hypocrisy, double standards, and the bold faced lying about reddit being place where real discussion can happen when that discussion, when not breaking the rules, still has to match what the admins want to get the same treatment as everyone else.  Not an american, not a trump supporter, but I will quit reddit and find somewhere else to go if they don't treat non rule breaking subs equally.  I put up with the fat shaming people because as repugnant as they were, if they didn't break the rules I didn't want to impugn their speech.  /u/spez merely showed the world that the echo chambers that produced president donald trump (not trumps echo chamber - the democrat echo chamber that decided it was a good idea to run hillary and spend the whole campaign making fun of trump instead of talking anything other than identity politics) can't deal with opposing views and would rather continue to try to marginalize the election winners even after being exposed as breaking his own rules.  /u/spez - I know you receive a lot of (crude) hatemail and mentions by name on this site, but I hope you read this post.  I am not a trump supporter, I'm not even from the USA, and I will leave reddit if reddit cannot handle reality.  "

Conservative,"&gt; It is a survival tactic. If you want to have someone who is even remotely conservative elected, you need to win general elections. Period dot end of the argument. It's fine and dandy to be a principled loser, but if you go down with the ship then don't expect to have any say in what comes after.  That is a silly argument. Why would I have any say when Trump loses anyway? Given the polls it looks like what is going to happen. Trump is going to lose and the conservatives will not have a say.  But in the fantasy world where he wins, how is it again that Social Conservatives have a voice in this new populist party Trump supporters have created?  &gt; In this election in particular, with the individual opposite Trump as starkly bad as she is, I cannot fathom why you are agitating for Trump to do something - anything - to lessen his chances. This is particularly important given that he might actually be a candidate who can move the dial in hitherto Democrat states. If he can steal electoral votes from Hillary then we need that.  Can you explain how Trump is soo much better considering his record before 2010 compared to Hilliary for a social conservative? I really don't see that as much of a difference. Also this presumes a binary choice which I am not prepared to concede.  Also the electoral votes from democratic states is laughably absurd given the polls. If there was any evidence of this, don't you think we would see some additional likelihood from betting and things like that? Furthermore, even Democrats are thanking God Trump was elected. A lot of them think Hilliary would have lost to anyone else. Trump fails the laugh test.  If the culture war is over then why were Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio doing so well? Heck if it hadn't been for both of them being in the race, one of them would have won(if you calculate the average percentage of Rubio voters whose second choice was Cruz and vice versa).   Further you didn't address the points directed him."

Republican,"To preface, I considered myself a Republican before Trump. I voted for Mitt in 2012. I have never voted Libertarian in a presidential election before. The Republican party as it is today is something myself and many Republicans (including Mitt) can no longer identify with. As a former Republican I consider the ticket of Johnson/Weld, both former Republicans themselves more suitable to me.  The idea of ""restarting the GOP"" appeals to me, but without knowing what that means I think it would negligent to join that movement. Personally, I would like the Republican party to be more socially inclusive and to be true fiscal conservatives.   The GOP as it was is now dead, so the conversation of what happens next has to happen. Does the party realign itself to match the values of a larger percentage of Americans, or does the party lose influence on a national scale and a new one fills the void (Libertarian or something else).

We don't have the means to have a completely free market banking system, so not regulating in some manners while regulating in others only leads to banks getting larger without the threat of competition.

I don't mind anyone being a Billionaire from running a bank, and I don't blame anyone who does what the Government allows them to get away with, within the means of the law. However, allowing banks to artificially get larger does not help Capitalism."

That's true: everyone needs butter. But it doesn't address your lack thereof, so it's dickish to say under the circumstances.  I don't know if the black community is being treated unfairly, but if there are complaints I think it'd be good to investigate. Also I don't think the movement BLM is doing the right thing.

They're still clinging to the Christian conservative ideal, missing everything the Alt Right brings to the table with more liberal and accepting social policies."
Conservative,I'm nearly 100% convinced that's the moment he decided to run
democrats,I agree with you.  How do we address professors that act like they should be on a list or two?

If he wanted to defend his religion, oh yeah, he's got the right party.   Democrats love to use minority groups for their political ends, he just became another casualty among many.

Conservative,"Someone on Facebook explained it to me like this:   You're at a dinner and everyone is passing food around filling up their plates, but Eric has no food. Eric says ""Eric deserves food"" and everyone agrees and says ""No, everyone deserves food.""  However, Eric still doesn't have any food.  That's their reasoning is that while everyone is saying ""All lives matter"" the black people are still being gunned down by racist cops and being kept down in a white supremacist system.  This explanation is complete bullshit.  If Black Lives Matters really gave a damn about black lives they'd speak up about the blacks who gun down other blacks in places like Chicago.  But no, they only speak up when a white cop guns down a black suspect and ignore the fact that most of the time, that suspect was dangerous.    If the dinner analogy where more accurate, it would be that everyone was at a dinner passing the food around, Eric had more food than everyone else and when someone got to the main course before he did, he'd shout ""Eric deserves food"".  And when people respond with ""No, everyone deserves food."" Eric would bitch and moan.  Meanwhile, no one is allowed to point out that Eric was first to the table, that Eric has grabbed more food than anyone else, that Eric didn't bring or cook any of the food and he's not going to do the dishes and anyone who dares point that out is a hateful and selfish person and when Eric goes back for seconds and finds that there are no more dinner rolls he gets pissed, trashes the dining room and storms out shouting ""Eric Deserves Food!"" while forgetting that he actually had more dinner rolls than everyone else.  Not only are we forced to listen to Black Lives Matter and be told that All Lives Matters is racist, but, corporations have hiring managers who will promote and hire blacks over whites.  BET is allowed to be a thing while a white version is automatically racist.  Blacks chant BLM when a black man is gunned down by cops, screaming racism while ignoring the fact that more whites are killed by cops than blacks.  Those who push the Black Lives Matter shit aren't exactly doing anything to better their communities either.  Some are I am sure, but you aren't helping out when you destroy your neighborhood or community to protest that a man who tried to kill a cop was killed in the process.   "

Conservative,"That's not what happened apparently, Apparently it was a threat of tariff and discussion of the corporate tax regime planned next year.  According to fortune, Indiana only gave them $700k in tax relief, and they are losing at net of $40M/yr in profit.  I think UTX sees Obamacare going away and a lower corporate tax rate and possible renegotiation of NAFTA (while making enemies of the administration) as being a bad thing if they moved. No telling what would happen to them.  Indiana said that the closure of the factory would cost the state $108M/yr: http://www.indystar.com/story/money/2016/06/17/carrier-closing-cost-indiana-economy-108m-year/85930170/  This is a massive victory."
Conservative,"You missed the whole small cell deployment part of that post, huh?  Mobile networks have brought internet to parts of the planet that never had any form of internet before.  Where Google fiber's landlines fail to break in, there are other technologies that could grow to compete in that space.  As the demand for mobile data increases, so does wireless infrastructure.  My phone already beats my landline in performance by a wide margin, and I've no use for cable TV (cut): pretty conceivable that I'll be cutting my landline out altogether for internet, too."
Conservative,"&gt; When you fight with facts there is no open endedness so you shut down people's beliefs that were built on emotions   Haha, if only.  Even if we could agree on what is a fact, which we clearly cannot, there's so much bullshit everywhere that it's trivial to ignore facts that should obliterate one's beliefs as ""bias"" and move on unphased.  People seek out validation, accepting agreement as true without hesitation and treating contradiction with anything from skepticism to ostracism.  Confirmation bias is just human nature, and it's easier than ever.  Anyone who doesn't catch themselves doing it sometimes isn't paying attention.  And all that aside, even assuming we could all agree on the facts of what is and what was, politics is mostly about what would, should, and will happen, to which there can be no definitive answer.  And don't forget that your opponent believes just as strongly that you're the one arguing from emotion."

It is a meme stash aimed at annoying Reddit users.  A toxic circle jerk.   There is no debate. There are no arguments.   It's not an intellectual loss for you folks.   For example, they took a ridiculous pizza pedo conspiracy theory and used to to harass mods and u/spez calling them pedophiles.   How would you react if that happened to you over and over?   If someone repeatedly called me a pedo i would be furious. I think many of you would too. I would have a hard time respecting the opinions of those folks.   These aren't conservatives. They are toxic 4chan type people that aren't furthering any cause or interest other than provoking Redditors that mainly want to see puppies and kittens.   I for one think you guys make Reddit a better place and don't think this is an attack on conservative thought per se.   I respect any disagreement you have with this, but it's my two cents. "
Conservative,"It turns out, even without having to negotiate with Democrats, Trump's already shifted that far on his stances.  Just in the course of a political campaign he's gone from ""deport them all"" to ""have that conversation later"".  Imagine if he actually has to deal with Congress.  He's already starting at the Rubio plan.  You're acting like he's already negotiated with the left on this, LOL  "

As soon as I debunk one or explain why one is stupid (I had TS Clearance and worked in an intell sell so I know a bit about fucking emails) they have another conspiracy. There is never a second where they have any reconciliation.    It's never, ""Huh if that was wrong maybe this story of her bribing the FBI is wrong or these thousands of other stories are"".

Conservative,"Of course they are.  In general, leftist politics are all about blaming everyone except for the one whose fault it actually is."
Republican,"That's fair. While I don't like it, reluctant or qualified support of Trump on the basis of the Supreme Court or being #neverhillary is very different from being a water-carrying Jeff Sessions type. Those jackasses can get lost, but I can justify supporting most of the others."

Republican,"Originally, alt-Right is like alternative media. Basically, they were anyone who disagreed with establishment Republicans. They were outsiders of many different points of views. Then the White Nationalist and the 1488 crowd began to take over.  Today the alt-Right is dominated by White Nationalist racist like Richard Spenser.  People are starting to reject the term alt-Right. Recently Stephen Bannon rejected racism and said that he is not a White Nationalist. Just an economic Nationalist.   "

I'd rather this not happen because in the end, people who went through this are going to wind up on drugs, in jail, or die prematurely.

Conservative,I couldn't bring myself to tell my grandkids that I voted for either candidate. What you say is true but I'm not voting for a racist because that's a lot of power to have.

Conservative,"Trump needs someone who can go on TV every day and promote his platform, and someone who can make an effort at rallying party holdouts to stop complaining about him.   Ignoring all of Christie's other flaws, he doesn't really meet either of those criteria.

Conservative,"An argument could be made that to be a hero an action should take place which could be considered ""heroic"". Being a victim should not necessarily be a qualifier.  I consider McCain to be a hero mostly for other actions, but I also consider  POWs and KIAs to be heros as well.   Just because I personally feel that their  sacrifice makes their actions of fighting in the face of peril more meaningful doesn't mean others can't feel differently though."
Conservative,"I am not going to persuade him. I don't intend to persuade anyone here. Few can be. People usually have their own realities and they stick to it.   I was making a point.   It isn't hyperbole.  ISIS has the power to rape women. Reddit has the power to censor comments. They are in fact the same thing. Abuse of power. You can say - reddit isn't doing anything illegal. True. In ISIS territory, ISIS isn't doing anything illegal.  See? I made a persuasive point showing how your point was wrong. But you will now double down on your wrong statement instead of admitting you were wrong. You may admit you were wrong but then that would be reverse psychology coming in."

Notably these bills are the same as those presented in the Senate by John Cornyn (R-TX) and Susan Collins (R-Maine)  So the plan is for the government to unilaterally remove the rights of persons without the opportunity for them to present a defense, and then force them to prove their innocence.  Will someone please explain to me how this works in terms of ""Innocent until proven guilty"", what other rights they would like to see removed by a rubber-stamp court which people then must fight to regain, and why the following Republicans think this is a good plan?

Republican,"Then we are similar.  I, too, have always voted Republican ... but cannot vote Republican this time around.  Gary Johnson, however, does NOT match my views or those of most Republicans.  He might have CALLED himself a Republican before claiming his rightful mantle as Libertarian ... but he's in left-field on a number of issues.  Remember ... as I said, they are playing things close to the vest because they want to attract Republican voters this year...but....  Let me preface the rest by saying ... Trump should teach us that we cannot be politically stupid when when the folks in DC are politically shrewd: i.e. Before Obama decided to run, he met with Tom Daschle.  He told Daschle that he couldn't really run, because he was just a new Senator with no experience under his belt.  Daschle told him, ""On the contrary, this is the time.  You haven't done anything that they can pin on you yet.""  Some in Illinois said, ""Don't trust this guy not to go after guns, he voted to hold manufacturers liable when he was in the legislature here!""  In fact, Illinois replaced him with a Republican.  Remember how Obama ran as anti-gay marriage in 2008?  Politically shrewd.  So on to Johnson....  He is pro open borders:    https://alibertarianfuture.com/2016-election/the-five-differences-between-gary-johnson-and-rand-paul/  At the same time, Libertarians seek an end to all welfare programs.  Republicans DO NOT seek an end to all welfare programs.  Gary Johnson thinks ALL drugs should be legalized.  http://observer.com/2016/02/this-presidential-candidate-thinks-all-drugs-should-probably-be-legalized/   That is NOT a Republican position.  While many of us are softening on the idea of legal marijuana.   We, in general, recognize that legalizing things like meth, heroin, and crack would be a disaster in the making.  And when I say WE... I'm talking about Republicans in general ... NOT the younger, liberal, secular brand found on Reddit.  Now ... I don't blame folks who want to vote for Johnson.  I have family who are doing so and I'm considering it... but I'm not going to do so with blinders on.  I don't blame anyone who wants to vote for him ... but know what you are getting.  &gt;The GOP as it was is now dead, so the conversation of what happens next has to happen.

Conservative,"That's what they do, LGBTQIAP++ P as in pedo.  They try to distance themselves from the name, but their behavior hasn't changed, they're still sexualizing children and exposing them to sexualized behaviors and topics at very young ages, generally without the parents being fully aware of what is going on.  Case in point, ""Jessica"" Yaniv had many supporters in those circles when people began to question her idea of having a ""no parents allowed"" swimming party featuring children and adult trans people, at least one of which (Yaniv himself) was caught making very un-subtle and repeated sexual overtures toward young girls.  It's not just that the parents don't know because they aren't paying attention (which is often the case as well), but that the people organizing these events are deliberately misrepresenting them or deliberately omitting information that would most definitely alter the decisions of many or most of those parents.  I have no problem with anyone being gay, do what you please with your own body.  It's not for me, but whatever... my problem is when you try to essentially talk kids into it.  Leave the fucking kids out of it, and please leave the kid-fucking out of it.  Do what you want in your own home, keep your sexual behavior out of the schools and I'll extend the same courtesy, like I always have, and like every sane, moral adult has always done."

Conservative,"If Clinton is elected in November, the people are basically saying in one unified voice ""we are OK with corruption"". "
Conservative,"&gt; But in the fantasy world where he wins, how is it again that Social Conservatives have a voice in this new populist party Trump supporters have created?  They'll have more of a say than if Hillary is elected.  Plus, Trump won't have the entirety of the Democratic Party and federal bureaucracy (plus the SCOTUS and appellate courts) working ceaselessly to destroy everything that Social Conservatives hold dear.  Hillary will.  &gt; Can you explain how Trump is soo much better considering his record before 2010 compared to Hilliary for a social conservative?  Because he is running as a conservative this year, whereas Hillary is running as one of the most progressive and liberal candidates in history?  Even if Trump is lying about half of his positions, he is still the better choice overall if only because of the fact that he keeps Hillary out of power.  As mentioned earlier, Trump does not have an entire machine working in support of him.  If he steps over a line, Congress and the Republican Party will toast him.  If Hillary steps over a line, the Democrats will *praise* her.    &gt; Also this presumes a binary choice which I am not prepared to concede.  Sure, sure, McMullin can sweep the nation in a landsli--- oh wait he's only on 12 ballots.  Maybe Gary 'Hillary Lite' Johnson will win?  I somehow doubt that.  Ooh, maybe you hope Stein wins?  It's a binary choice.  Sticking your fingers in your ears and going 'lalalalalala' doesn't change that.    &gt; Also the electoral votes from democratic states is laughably absurd given the polls.  He only has to swing one or two.  He's demonstrated crossover appeal, so... I guess we'll see if there's anything to it on election day.  &gt; A lot of them think Hilliary would have lost to anyone else.   I'm not sure if anyone else would have been able to survive the endless barrage of media attacks.  91% (!!!!) of media coverage of Trump has been negative.  The man is like the Juggernaut, ceaselessly driving forward despite the media's, the Republican party's, and his own attempts to cripple his campaign.    &gt; If the culture war is over then why were Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio doing so well?   Do remind me who won the primaries. "

Conservative,&gt; Trump did a ton of damage to thier brand by making them the poster child for sending jobs overseas. They had to respond in some way or risk losing market share to competitors.  It's almost like Trump has experience with getting things done for his entire life whereas Obama was a community organizer with no executive experience. 
Conservative,"&gt;Maybe you clicked this post hoping to see me as Princess Leia in the gold bikini. But no, sorry.  Damn"
Republican,Could you explain your comment further?  Because Republicans do not want zero taxation and zero social programs.  Republicans do not want open borders.  Republicans do not want a tiny military.  Republicans do not want legalization of every drug.  
Conservative,"Pretty much the same way with how I feel about GamerGate. Games you don't play are ""sexist""? Then make games that suit you. It's a free country. I'm not going to book stores and ripping up books I disagree with."

Conservative,"&gt; If the consensus among conservatives in the US is to not create any pathways to citizenship, what are the strongest arguments for this in your opinion?  Well for a starter, this is completely false.  There are ways to *legally* become a citizen of the US and Conservatives are generally super ok with this.  *That* process needs to be streamlined, no doubt.  TLDR; Start your stated consensus with a statement that is factual.  ""the consensus among conservatives in the US is to not create any pathways to citizenship"" is 100% false and whomever told you that is lying to you."

Conservative,"There are two things that really annoy me about this:  1) As a libertarian, he should be a champion of freedom of expression. Sure, he's not suggesting it be illegal to use the phrase, but he, as a politician, is trying to use his influence and forum to promote censorship, if only self-induced.   2) When asked why the phrase was offensive, he replied ""It just is. It just is."" I don't care what side of the aisle you are on, or what you are arguing- this is the most cop out excuse for a reason I have ever heard. What if I told you we had to build a wall, Gary, and you asked 'why', and I said 'We just do. We just do.' Would that hold water with you? "

Maybe that was a different case I heard about. She may be a victim who lied but if not then the principal’s statement is definitely inappropriate, but at the end of the day they’re kids."

Conservative,"&gt;Its legitimately sad that you can possibly think any of your replies have been intelligent or a ""gotcha!"" in any way. Literally the video you posted above is of Obama giving a speech that would probably be considered the most coherent speech of Trump's presidency.    The if if if if if if okie dokie speech following by the Orange Man Bad act.    Do you have a tricycle to finish off your act?  &gt;I am not talking about Trump as a president at all right now, ""orange man bad"" has nothing to do with this. I am purely talking about ability to public speak, and somehow you are so blinded and butthurt that it is impossible for you to admit that there has never been a president worse at public speaking than Trump.  So you admit to being an Oranage Man Bad  clown. That's a start. Now you just have to admit that Obama needs a telepromter to avoid having if if if if if okie dokie moments. Obama is a worse public speaker when he doesnt have someone scripting his public speeches."

Conservative,"In some respects I think that decision actually makes sense. If they're looking to make the story a-political, a Trump shirt destroys that effort. Obviously the MSM sucks Hillary's penis on the regular, but for that particular story I agree the blur was warranted."
Republican,We can't make people who post here love Trump.  The convention threads that were posted had minimal activity.  If you think this is an anti-Trump circle jerk maybe it is because some Republicans who don't like him say that they have been driven from other subreddits by Trump supporters.
Republican,"Curious about what conservatives think about this part.  ""CNBC, which first broke the news, reported the company decided the savings that would result from moving to Mexico was not worth the fallout of incurring the wrath of the new administration, including the threat to the business it currently does with the government, such as orders for defense equipment.""

democrats,"I'm not sure if you were paying attention at the time, but that's how people framed the affordable care act. Sleep on it as you will.

Conservative,"Yes, sorry I did miss that.  Well in that case I agree completely.  I think the microcell is ultimately going to be an answer that solves the internet competition problem.  If you have lower powered antennas giving off signal that transmits to hundreds rather than thousands, it might be a workable solution.  You might have to assign different channels or different frequencies to separate carriers in a given area, but I think that it could be workable.    If NYC and highly dense cities manage to have high speed data shared among thousands of people per square mile I don't see how that model couldn't work on a smaller scale, such as block by block coverage rather than covering the whole neighborhood at once.

Do you have a moral obligation to continue spending your limited time and resources on this uninvited intruder? Or is it fair, if a bit harsh, to say ""sorry, not my problem; I never asked for this""?  I know you won't see these two as comparable, but like most of the rest of your post, that's purely subjective, and many people disagree.

It wasnt which candidate the country liked the most but which one they hated the least and Trump barely beat one of the most detestable corrupt candidates in recent memory.

Republican,"Here is how I understand Vegeta's comment:  Most Republicans say they want a small, limited government.

Conservative,You're full of crap on that one.  The main tactic of the Palestinians is terrorism.  And might that be considered Islamic terrorism?
Republican,"Right, that's fair. I have my differences with Johnson as well although for a variety of reasons I couldn't vote for Trump (or Hillary).  One thing I do think is important to point out is that Johnson and Weld are much more moderate than many members of their party. My understanding is there was a pretty big division at their convention over people who supported the pragmatic Johnson/Weld ticket, and people who really just wanted an anarchist. Welfare would be a great example of this. Johnson has repeatedly said that there should be a safety net, but government currently tries to do too much and existing entitlements are simply unsustainable. Discussing entitlements has typically political suicide so I respect him for being willing to talk about what everyone knows is a problem. I saw Mitt give a presentation on entitlements about 2 years ago that mirrors a lot of what Johnson says. Historically the Libertarian party was basically anarchists as you alluded to, so it will be interesting to see if the membership changes or if Johnson/Weld is just a one-time blip.  On drugs Johnson has said that while he favors completely ending the war on drugs he doesn't think it is politically feasible or politically favored so he will only push for marijuana. I think on harder drugs he'd like to focus more on the demand side of the equation believing that if demand is there supply will be there too. Something has to be done differently on all drugs and I think he's pragmatic and open about what that is. At a libertarian event he was asked if a 5 year old should be allowed to legally buy heroin. He answered no, which bothered some of the more extreme members of the party.   I tend to favor open borders which was one of the few areas I disagreed with Rand. I think immigration is good for the economy. Sergey Brin, Elon Musk, lots of Americas great entrepreneurs are immigrants. There's a willingness to take risks to achieve a better future that defines immigrants. I've never met someone who moved to America for social welfare. Clearly the current system of undocumented immigration doesn't work though and there has to be some way of controlling it.  "

I'll even compromise with Democrats; if we make it so children have to wait until they are 18 to go through gender transition surgery I'll even be in favor of tax dollars paying for it. Not because I want tax dollars to be funding these surgeries, but because I would rather take that trade off if it meant we stopped allowing abusive parents to decide for their children to go through with these surgeries."
Conservative,And there is a great way to enforce that: make sure 51% or more of your profits are alcohol then those with conceal carry licenses would be unable to carry in your stores.  Without that you have no legal way to enforce that.    At least in Texas...

That LGBTQ-IA youth are exposed to these additional risk factors, atop those normally increasing one’s risk for suicidal ideation and completed suicide, helps to explain why sexual minority youth are at a greater risk of desiring to end, and sometimes successfully ending, their own lives.  &gt;Specific to sexual minority youth, family cohesion, school safety, and the perception of being cared for and about by adults outside the nuclear family have been found to lower the risk of suicide and suicidal ideation (Haas et al., 2011).

So, now that you've been presented with evidence that the lack of tolerance is in fact the reason that the suicide rate is so high, are you going to continue to act like the problem is ""how gender dysphoria is treated""? Or are you going to try to be more tolerant and supportive of LGBTQ peoples?"

Liberal,"Your an idiot. Form your opinions based on facts, not wishful thinking.  http://m.sparknotes.com/us-government-and-politics/american-government/political-parties/section2.rhtml  &gt; In the United States, a candidate wins the election by gaining a plurality, or more votes than any other candidate. This is a winner-take-all system because there is no reward for the party or candidate that finishes second. Parties aim to be as large as possible, smoothing over differences among candidates and voters. There is no incentive to form a party that consistently gets votes but cannot win an election. As a result, two political parties usually dominate plurality electoral systems to the disadvantage of smaller third parties, just as the Democrats and the Republicans dominate the American political system. No one person or organization prevents third parties from forming, but the plurality system itself usually hinders their efforts to win votes.  I have no idea why I am even arguing with you over this simple and easy to understand reality."

Edit: Favorite part: the flip flop...instead of ""They've got to leave"", which he said about anchor babies and their families, and every trump supporter defended, he says:  &gt;In several years, when we have accomplished all of our enforcement goals – and truly ended illegal immigration for good, including the construction of a great wall, and the establishment of our new lawful immigration system – then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those who remain.

Conservative,A low minimum wage allows people with no employment background and no real skills to get both.  Minimum wage is not made for you to live on and if you see it as something to support you and your family on your problem is settling for the bare minimum.  A $15/hour minimum wage is going to make retail and fast food jobs very limited to come by and make the competition for such jobs asinine and even those who get those jobs will find very few hours and stressful working conditions.  All made worse by illegal aliens who will put up with the shit conditions of fast food and terrible hours since it's better than the $2/hour they'd make in Mexico.  This is going to pretty much force more people into debt as they must go to school to get training for any job out there.

Conservative,"high price isn't a good way to maximize profit. A competitive market will punish you for having high prices, so companies will always be looking to lower their prices wherever possible. A GREAT example of this is the ""Bean Wars"" of the 90s, where international corporations competed against local markets for selling tins of beans by lowering prices as much as possible, eventually ending with one seller offering beans for negative two pence. The reason why they could turn a profit from it is due to them selling other foods as well, but I digress. A competitive market drives prices down, which is why a monopoly is something to be prevented. Then again, monopolies don't form when entrepreneurs are able to create alternatives, which happens when regulations are minimal (minimal regulation also minimizes production cost). Think about it, if corporations act like assholes to customers, then why would the customer buy their product or hire their service if there's an equally competent competitor? Market share and minimal cost are what corporations use to maximize profit, not maximized price tags."

For this speech in particular, I felt like he focused more on building the relationship with Mexico, showing a diplomatic sense, and it was all nothing more than a photo-op, rather than forcing on the issue at hand and making a mess of it. It's the process of ""schmoozing"" before you even try to settle on a deal.  Yeah, he's not president, but in a way, the whole election process is his negotiation with the American people."

It is being subverted by liberals who believe the ends justify the means, and right now their agenda is best instituted by a rigged supreme court."
Conservative,"Yeah, the one problem with this plan, is it assumes EVERY government manager/director is purely motivated by self profit. A lot of government agents, especially in the military where this practice is rampant, are very much concerned with making sure their peers and employee's can actually perform their department's duties before their personal interests.   What's needed  is a means for departments that are efficient spenders to earn a sort of credit that allows them to draw on a larger emergency coffer when they really need. That, and then a way to make sure said coffer doesn't become a slush fund for any crony's pet project (maybe put it behind a legislative hearing)"

Republican,"&gt; encouraging government oversight on social issues.   No one does social issues like the Democrats, though.  They throw social issues down everyone's throat like no other party.  Yet, the GOP is frequently blamed when the left pushes social issues that come into conflict with the Constitution.  For the purpose of illustration, here are some examples:  Gun control.  This is a social issue.  The GOP fights for the Constitutional right of citizens to own guns.  The left fights to limit that right based on things that have happened in society.  Religious hospitals.  Watch this one as it develops.  Catholic hospitals that have served communities for over a century were recently sued to provide abortions.  This was thrown out... but how would you feel if the government said that hospitals that do not provide abortions should lose any federal funding?  This would include Medicaid/Medicare payments for those who walked in and needed care.  Schools losing federal funding if they don't let boys use the the girls' locker room/bathroom.

I'm not sure on what grounds, but this whole thing has been a social justice pursuit that cited cherry picked studies.  They rely on these studies that will of course yield positive results, but then they don't look at what is lost. I always tell people that I bet you could increase memory retention if you yell a lot. So you create a study with teachers yelling certain facts that are really important or something, and then yuo test the students and it'll turn out the students who were yelled at with the most important information actually did better. So then academia jumps on this and develops it more and it's this big circle jerk, and suddenly you have Common Core 2: The Yelling.  Sometimes the standard rote learning is the best, that doesn't mean we shouldn't pursue better results with other options, particularly for students who struggle more, but fitting the teaching around the students who struggle most, creates a system that doesn't help the ones who could be the most successful. You bring the bar down for everyone. It's insane.  So I think parents with kids around 7 or so should be banding together to sue or something because clearly the system is screwed up and the money you are paying to schools is not yielding results.

Republican,"Its an interesting idea - but you're not going to be able to do it anonymously for very long.  ...and if it is going to succeed in differentiating itself from the current Republican party, it is going to need to prohibit anyone who publicly associated themselves with Trump or the Republican Establishment from being part of the core.    That's going to make it very challenging to succeed, as the Establishment has proven itself absolutely willing to go to any lengths to crush grassroots efforts to reform the party, up to and including mustering Democrats against grassroots Republican candidates."
Conservative,Not Trump. Keep the govt out of it. We should contact Thiel ourselves and express our desire.

democrats,"Thanks for saying what a lot of us feel and think about what could be done better. We didn't need all that money Hillary raised from the donor class. We needed enthusiasm and volunteers more than money. Sanders had them and so did Trump, but when I looked around in ""north country"" there were rarely even Hillary lawn signs and Congressional Candidates were starved for money and volunteers.  Hillary raised twice as much money as Trump but it was money poorly utilized."

Liberal," &gt;According to the Daily Mail, a woman filed an April 2016 lawsuit claiming that when she was thirteen years old she was held as a sex slave to Mr. Trump and his friend Jeffrey Epstein.  Epstein was Bill Clinton's friend too...  &gt;Trump has denied Jane Doe’s claims and his reps have said he barely knew Epstein—even though New York media in the ’90s regularly chronicled his comings-and-goings at Epstein’s Upper East Side palace, and even though Epstein had 14 private numbers for Trump and his family in his little black book. Meanwhile, Bill and Hillary Clinton have remained mum about their ties to the Palm Beach pedophile—despite evidence that shows Bill was one of the most famous and frequent passengers on Epstein’s “Lolita Express” and that Epstein donated money to the Clinton Foundation even after his conviction.

Republican,"I've considered it heavily as an alternative to Trump but there are two issues I can't get past: 1. Her legacy as Secretary of State: Her decision to bomb Libya (NY Times said Obama was leaning against and she convinced him) and her support for rebels in Syria both greatly contributed to the chaos that exists today and allowed ISIS to be what they are. She continues to pus for Assad's removal, which I think is the lesser of two evils since the other choice is ISIS. She also takes every chance she gets to weaken US-Russian relations, her unfounded quips last week that they sabotaged the DNC included. 2. Stance on free trade: I support free trade and can't figure out what her position is. Bill signed NAFTA and she helped negotiate TPP. Now she seems to be against both, which I think would be a terrible change of direction for the country. "

It happens all the time, property is a prized possession everywhere in the world. It stands to reason that people would frequently murder each other over it, given the pettiness other murders are motivated by. Regardless of professed religion. And given that white, Christian landowners are far more frequent in America than non-white Muslims, it stands to reason that they actually kill more over property disputes than Muslims do as a characteristic of demographics.  But no one bothered to make an effort in actually looking this up - conservatives, like liberals, have engaged in identity politics, and identity politics make people stupid. There's a valid case against Islam as an ideology, but you're only destroying your own credibility by playing identity politics of ""us vs them"" in the same way the left does.  We have to be intelligent, and put aside emotion and snap judgements if we want to leverage reason and build a winning argument."

The only winning scenario that I have been able to come up with is that the delegates should run Trump's VP pick as our nominee for president.  (Assuming he doesn't pick Palin or Carson.).  Trump supporters would be pissed, but by picking Trump's hand-picked successor, they could be persuaded to vote.  Then for the VP slot, pick a governor like Jindal, Perry, or Walker.  (The VP matters very little this time - so the right choice would depend on which faction needs the most shoring up.)"

In real life, people who think differently are normal and healthy, not something to expel and destroy."
Conservative,"I'm a leftist, and I have a question. Why is there such an outrage? Generally Trump supporters are conservatives and pro-free market. Why is it such a big deal when Google, Twitter, Reddit, or Facebook attempt to censor right wing news? They are private companies that can do whatever they want.

Conservative,"This us where the smart choice is IMO. If a particular agency is outdoing the others they should gain a little more leeway when asking for budget increases. For instance a police department spent 150 thousand under budget for five years, asks for a budget increase of 100 thousand to start a new program, perhaps an expanded traffic law enforment program(not really making a point on what is worthy of funding, I just have a pet peeve for people who don't use their turn signals :P). In my opinion, that's a fairly straight forward decision, since the choice will no longer carry the worry of whether the department will spend the funds inappropriately. Instead it is whether the expenditure is justified."

I understand the majority of you racist rednecks can't even read this post, though. But those who can, please pass my message on to the rest of your inbred family.  We Democrats are morally, culturally and intellectually superior to you in every way. I will qualify myself by noting that I have a Liberal Arts degree from a college, which you obviously have never been to, if you even know what one is. I'm also bi-sexual. I have been told by several professors that everything you hold dear is terrible. Therefore you, personally, are also terrible.  I don't know you, but I know that you're racist. I also know that you hate gay people and still get scared when you see anyone with squinty eyes and brown skin.  The religion which you hold closely, greatly believe in, and which brings you comfort-- is wrong because I'm smarter than you and I'm telling you so. It is one of the many reasons why you are stupid and that I'm better than you.  You see, us Democrats want a system which helps everyone in the world. Our system is designed around love and kindness to everyone. If you don't agree, I hate you.  It's not too late to change. If you knew your history, which of course you don't, you'll remember a time in America when Indians were dragged away from their homes and forced to assimilate into white society. Well, we want to change that kind of behaivior (sorry for my spelling, as I'm not from your country) by making sure you go to college and have a small apartment in a big, busy coastal city, filled with crime and poverty, where you belong. That will help you rid yourselves of your backward, incorrect culture and way of thinking. We'll do everything we can to make sure you agree with us and say all the right things and not be brainwashed against thinking the same way we do.    Vote Blue you stupid mother fuckers!

Conservative,"&gt;  Many on the left are saying it's a hardline immigration speech, it's dark, etc.  Big shock there, they all had their list of talking points prepped beforehand. If Trump softened at all they were supposed to say ""it will alienate his base! He flip flopped!"" if he maintained or softened only slightly it's ""IT'S DARK AND EVIL!""  That's the way it goes with Trump, nothing he does is OK, everything is a mistake.  I personally disagree with Trump's deportation idea, I think he should have softened slightly on the issue. Mostly because Hillary will never address the issue at all and there's no way she will give a speech on illegal immigration anytime soon.  I personally think that advocating for a border wall, saying that Mexico itself also agreed it's mutually beneficial and disallowing all illegals here from ever voting in their lifetimes or gaining legal status would have been enough."

Some conditions caused by an overactive immune system are:  * Asthma. The response in your lungs can cause coughing, wheezing, and trouble breathing. Asthma can be triggered by common allergens like dust or pollen or by an irritant like tobacco smoke.  * Eczema. An allergen causes an itchy rash known as atopic dermatitis.  * Allergic rhinitis.

Republican,"Part of becoming a part of a party is understanding that you are not going to get 100% of what you want.  For instance, I personally am pro-choice.  However, as I have gotten older... I have come to the conclusion that limits on how late you can have an abortion are the ethical and moral thing to do.  I find it personally abhorrent when I hear some speak of a fetus as a parasite or a clump of cells with zero understanding of what that clump of cells can become.  And I am always examining my beliefs and positions and occasionally changing them in light of new discoveries or epiphanies or information.  What you are saying is that maybe we should shove all of the social conservatives out of the tent because they make the social liberals uncomfortable.  But that is not how it works.  Examine yourself and your conscience on the individual issues and decide which party best represents you and then try to work towards common change to oppose those who DO NOT represent you.  Make sure that when you come to your conclusions about which position you take ... you can understand and maybe even empathize with the folks who don't agree with you about it.  Even though I'm pro-choice, I totally understand and empathize with the pro-life crowd and do not find them to be a negative force deserving of disrespect.  I think that gay couples deserve the same marriage rights as straight couples, but I understand the objections of those who oppose gay marriage.  I just heard a saying today ... a snippet, even, on tv of a speech ... ""we cannot start talking to each other until we stop yelling at each other""."

Liberal,"So cut of your nose to spite your face. Republican victories led to more conservative candidates and policies. If Hillary wins, demographics are in the favor of Democrats and liberals. We will enter a 30 year period of liberal dominance. Or we could have 30 years of a conservative Supreme Court, and make minimal gains. This is the last stand for the hard right. We put them in their place this time, we don't have to worry about them (barring some unforseen event) for 30-40 years. Or we can sabotage ourselves to their delight. The choice is obvious to me."
Conservative,Yes.  Did I ever say I wasn't?
Republican,And they're...immigrants.

Conservative,Almost perfect. Only thing missing is: Think of the children!
democrats,I truly think he doesn't want to win. I believe he did it for attention. This is just to ensure he loses. He will blame everyone else but he knows what he is doing and that is losing an election on purpose.
Republican,...and if Trump goes for Bernie as his VP?
Conservative,"He's an independent write-in in most states, and on the ballot in a few others. More info here: https://www.evanmcmullin.com/vote  Edit: Any particular reason this was downvoted?lol "
Conservative,"PIVOT  &gt;In several years, when we have accomplished all of our enforcement goals – and truly ended illegal immigration for good, including the construction of a great wall, and the establishment of our new lawful immigration system – then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those who remain. That discussion can only take place in an atmosphere in which illegal immigration is a memory of the past, allowing us to weigh the different options available based on the new circumstances at the time.  Different from last year's stance on anchor babies and non-criminal families:  &gt;“We’re going to keep the families together. We have to keep the families together, but they have to go.”  And what ""new circumstances""?  Will time have made these illegals now legal?  Lol.  You guys got your pivot, and you'll pretend like it isn't there. "
Conservative,"""conservative"""
democrats,"I've heard some people describing them as ""Vichy progressives"".  They claim to be progressives, but they sold us out to the fascists.   "
Conservative,Just like how they all said Trump was going to lose in a landslide...
democrats,Great news now I can ignore it because we have work to do and votes to cast in 2020.
Conservative,You want to know why Trump is President?  This is why.  A bunch of average Americans are finally saying the left has gone too far and has to be stopped.
Conservative,[deleted]
democrats,"Anyone who didn't get out to vote against Trump and for Hillary in the general election was never, ever really a progressive, whatever they call themselves."
Liberal,[deleted]
Republican,"Got banned permanently today from r/sandersforpresident today because I said that in the name of sanders’ successful 2020 Presidential campaign that I would redistribute Halloween candy tonight from kids who have too much candy to kids who don’t have enough instead of handing out candy equally to all.  They weren’t impressed, had no sense of humor and were totally rude.  Don’t worry about it my friend, there are plenty of normal people out there."
Liberal,I'm interesting how VSO's might take this.
Conservative,"All subreddits are equal, but some subreddits are more equal than others. "
Conservative,How convenient 
Republican,Its coming from Hillary.  Its all BS.  The only person likely to put up a less truthful platform on something is Trump.
Conservative,Will do.
democrats,It was in SC-1 that a Dem was able to defeat a GOP candidate for House who basically ran on a platform of enabling Trump.  Hope he pulls it off!
Conservative,"&gt;Gender ideology being forced on kids &gt;Changing 2,000+ year old institution  What’s wrong with changing how gender is taught? What’s wrong with changing marriage? Just because a 2,000 year old book tells us to do it one way means it can never change? Don’t you think that’s kinda nonsensical?  &gt;Forcing Christians to participate  Refusing to do your job because you don’t approve of someone’s sexual orientation is childish, and as a Roman Catholic I believe Jesus taught us to love everyone, as we are all created in God’s image. You’re not seriously telling me people will be mentally scarred for begrudgingly selling a cake or approving a marriage license.  &gt;Putting transgender athletes in sports  This I can agree with. There are definitely sports where being a trans woman or trans man can give you the physical advantage, and we’ve seen examples of this.   &gt;Sharing bathrooms  [There is no correlation between gender neutral bathroom laws and bathroom safety.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13178-018-0335-z) Also, what is wrong with being an adult with mental illness? Or specifically, being an adult with gender dysphoria? Why do we need to demonize people with mental illnesses? It doesn’t do any good for this world.  &gt;doxxing  There are also people who dox and kill LGBT people. If we delegitimize either side’s argument based on the actions of a few people, then we will never reach agreement.  I still genuinely don’t get it. You haven’t told me why the rest of these points are bad or harmful."
Liberal,There were 4 in that election because Democrats split in 2.    There's plenty of dissension within the parties. It's not impossible.   I'm hopeful for democracy. You're the one playing lesser evil. 
Liberal,1860s 
Conservative,Can someone bring an illegal concealed firearm into a Levis Strauss store? Because they aren't going to pay any attention to whatever their policy is.
Conservative,I member.....member when there weren't so many Mexicans?
Conservative,"lol of course not, it was a truly absurd claim without any basis but good to know."
Conservative,"This story should be forwarded to the trustees, I'm sure they'll read anyways, but people should make sure that they know that this is a huge fucking issue. These universities are only giant socialist utopias because they all sit on top of a dragon's horde of cash which can sustain them. Cut this down and the party is over. Alert the trustees. "
Conservative,"Maybe it's a ploy to prevent assassination, like Biden with obama"
Conservative,"Was UTC a company you spoke about a lot before Trump used them to make a point? For most of us the honest answer is probably no. You guys can debate semantics all you want. All I'm saying is this feels more like damage control and marketing than anything else. As I said in another comment, I hope I'm wrong. I look forward to eating crow when all the jobs come home... I'm just not gonna hold my breath."
Liberal,So... You weren't a supporter of the revolution? Just the candidate? Because this candidate is the opposite of what Bernie was fighting for.
Conservative,"It's cute how so many so called conservatives here like to give up their rights to the government in the name of security just because the word ""Muslim"" is stamped on it. Supporting this means you are giving more power to a corrupt system that erodes civil liberties. Pure and simple. "
Liberal,"""Fuck the white man"" said the white man trying to fuck that hot white chick with the big tits."
Conservative,But its a private company so technically they can do whatever they want.
Liberal,"Do you live in a swing state? If so, get some people mobilized!!"
Conservative,"&gt;thread, AutoMod says I have to “be active in the subreddit.” Any idea what that means?  Answer the message you get from the auto-mod when you comment in a ""Conservatives Only"" post. You can put ""Flair"" in the subject line, and in the body, tell them what you'd like your flair to be. They'll want to see a history of comments showing you're reliably conservative, and not a bunch that look lefty."
Conservative,[removed]
Liberal,"You are totally right, how could you prove that 9/11 was even real at all because it ""happened years ago."" Or how on earth could you prove that Ted Bundy even killed people because it was SO long ago."
Conservative,Who are the cockroaches? 
Conservative,"Last May, I took a train from D.C. to Baltimore to get on a flight back home. I was offered $500 dollars plus my hotel stay if I gave up my seat until the next morning. There was no way in hell I was going to spend the night in Baltimore."
Conservative,"Heh, nah."
Conservative,[deleted]
Conservative,Yes conservative. Tom Price is Conservative. Jeff Sessions is Conservative. Betsy Devos is Conservative
Conservative,i always lose it at sub human filth. lol
Conservative,Are tremendously fantastic
Republican,"True, but some 80 odd percent of the GOP voted for the CRA in its various forms (as opposed to 60%+- Dems) bc it had a lot less representation in the southern states at that point."
Conservative,And fucking frog memes. *So toxic*
Conservative,So socially liberal is the new euphemism for open borders...
Conservative,Why would you want the government to create a replacement?
Conservative,Love Louder w Crowder. 
Conservative,The left is much more organized and ruthless than conservatives are. They will violently harass people and businesses until they get their way. Something conservatives just can't do.
democrats,"They're calling Levi's ""Jew jeans""? I get that Levi Strauss was Jewish but Levi jeans are the most American thing besides apple pie and baseball!  These people don't behave like Americans.  It's so unsettling.  "
Conservative,"This is what you say when there's no actual point yo disparage trump with.   It wasn't a photo op, it started negotiond once more and its historic, a step towards a more diplomatic relationship which is the only option other than war which would be estimated to cause over 20 million deaths.   Not talking and meeting was working real well when a missile was flying towards us every 27 days in the last two years of Obama's term"
Conservative,So was it unrelated to Cory Booker or is he somehow involved in that?
Conservative,"He's actually my district.   On one hand he does indeed seem constitutionally minded and strong willed.   On the other, (I know it's not everything) as bad as it is to say, he doesn't have a college degree and his platform seems to come down to, paraphrasing, ""We need to fight the terrorists, and I will because I've done it and seen what they can do.""  That part of his platform is compelling, I'm not going to lie, but a congressman should be able to have a working knowledge of other areas as well.   But perhaps a combat wounded vet is just what Congress needs?   Idk, but he won over other experienced power players in my district, so people sympathise with him.   And should he do a good job, I'll support him in the future."
Conservative,CNN is doing the same lame shit they did last night where they get candidates to respond to the other candidates' attacks.  They care more about sound bites than running an actual debate.  What a shitshow.
Republican,"What's your opinion of Rand Paul?  He ran as a libertarian Republican candidate and I supported him until the day he dropped out of the race. I would even say he would be a good candidate for the GOP to realign itself with.   While the Libertarian party is unique from the GOP, I don't see that as any reason why the idea of libertarianism can't still exist in the GOP. "

Conservative,They'd have better luck if they started doing Mariachi bands and speaking spanish. 
Conservative,If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck it's probably a duck.
Conservative,And even whiter than America. 
Conservative,A decision like that should probably only be allowed after they are 18 or maybe even 21.
Conservative,This dude is not smart. I honestly feel indifferent about criticizing him any further because I borderline feel that he has an IQ of a potato. 
Conservative,Feminism is one of the most closely held tenets of liberalism. They can't have anyone who might expose it for what it is allowed to speak.
Conservative,During the elections it had enough serious posters to actually get really interesting topics discussed with substantial sourcing. Now it's a bunch of idiots drowning every intelligent post in fast food. I have to hide 30 posts an hour to make it usable. Mods are even banning long time posters who have questioned what they see is now out of control. 
Conservative,I'm afraid we have to roll with it.  The Romans used the dole for hundreds of years before the Republic fell and continued with bread and circus to keep the mob docile  thru out the Empire effectively.  Maybe just totally bombard them with virtual/digital toys to keep them distracted down in the basement.  Gotta say I live in a multi generational family with GenZ teenagers and Gen X parents and Boomer grandparents all living in the same compound and the Gen Zs and Gen Xers are  all working and I'm retired and own the property and it makes a lot of sense in. a lot of ways.  Granted my family dynamics might be happier thn most folks. Diversity quotas are entitlements so who ever wants to give up entitlements especially if it allow them to under perform?  We do agree that effective management of those with no real skin in the game is important.

Conservative,"Gee, I can't imagine why..."
Republican,Yes 
Conservative,"They censored conservative posts before, they're still doing it now, and they will continue to do it into the future. This really changes nothing, Reddit's /u/spez jerk off brigade is a direct arm of the crybaby campus ""political"" culture. I say ""political"" because it just amounts to shouting down any contrary view and labeling anything that wasn't spoon fed to them by Amy Schumer racist."
Conservative,Like when a majority voted for segregation?
Conservative,"The NRA, which San Francisco claimed was a terrorist organization, has a lot of quality training programs and to my knowledge, NRA members aren't the ones gunning each other down in the hood or going on shooting rampages in schools or workplaces."
Conservative,Sounds like a ton of feedback on her mic. Wonder if CNN can pick it up.
Conservative,But thedonald isn't being silenced..
Conservative,"Hopefully what? You never finished your sentence.  Anyway, I'm not too far off from your stance. Screw 'em. I'm not sticking up for thier business decisions and I'd rather not give them my money. I just think this is damage control from them not amazing deal making from Trump."
Conservative,&gt;What about it is toxic?  It does not follow the radical left's view of the world and encourages millennial to think different.
Conservative,"Out of the 20 candidates over the two debates, Kamala Harris is by far the best at this.  She tells people the leftist bullshit they want to hear without sounding crazy or insincere."
Conservative,"Straight out of the early voting results thus far: https://twitter.com/LarrySchweikart/status/792002498605096960  She's getting creamed in NC which is why Obama is only going to NC and no where else, primarily because black turnout is down 17% in the state from 2012, making it almost impossible for her to win. White voters are up nearly 25% in NC."
Conservative,Democrat platform if they were honest.
Conservative,"I had a slow day today, so  I was lurking on reddit way more then I should.  We had hillary go on a meltdown against Russia. Certain subs were silent then when the Slate server bs hit it took less then 20 min for tons of post "" This information is so accurate and true"". Now certain subs have their top story of a Secret spy claiming Trump was groomed and other bs stories. It is sick"
Conservative,"Making predictions about the future based on dodgy polling is extremely different to denying reality itself. Facts like climate change. Seriously. The world will look back at the 1970 to 2020 Republican party and think ""How the hell did they manage to convince so many people (as we're talking about you and your fellow retards here, I use the word people extremely loosely) of something so stupid"".  Honestly the press thought too much of America, it overestimated your ability to tell a human being from a baboon.  However I am so gleeful to see truly how much the Republican-fascists will fuck up our country in the next two years. Hopefully enough so that even brain-dead right wing troglodytes take note, but that's anyone's guess.  It won't be my state that suffers :)"
Conservative,"She didn't really ""rip"" the media. In fact it didn't even amount to criticism. It might have reached the level of mild chiding, tsk tsk. They had a laugh over it. There was no serious discussion. Two lefties talking about a Clinton. zzzzzzzzzzz"
Conservative,[deleted]
Conservative,I disavow my previous statement!
Conservative,"This seems like the biggest stretch of a pivot I've seen, but sure. This is a ""pivot"" and not a redefining of policy.   Personally I think Trump should have pivoted a bit more than he did, and as a supporter that's what I'd have preferred."
Liberal,I sure hope so.  But it's time to move on from Nancy pelosi 
Conservative,Better guns sound good. 
Republican,Funny this is what Trump is of course they put anti Trump BS. Where was this years ago?
Conservative,Rammstein?
Conservative,Thanks for replying.  Sincerely wondered your thoughts on it. 
Conservative,"&gt; This is a ""pivot"" and not a redefining of policy.  You're saying Trump was never planning to deport 11 million (or more)?  Fascinating.  Edit: can you clarify the difference between ""pivot"" and redefining policy?  It sounds like the same thing."
Conservative,"ruh roh, it's about to get ugly.  ""love trumps hate"" amirite"
Conservative,Genuinely curious. How would that prevent an assassination? 
Conservative, 
Conservative,We’re the party of the blue collar workers! Don’t agree with us? Well you’re stupid. Let us be smart while you’re being so stupid.
Conservative,"Trump won't prosecute Obama, Hillary on the other hand, I think Americans expect it."
Conservative,"If crowd sizes were actually indicative of anything Trump would be destroying Hillary. Romney lost primarily because his ground game was shit, Trump is making the same mistake."
Conservative,The only people surprised about this? Hillary's dumbass supporters.

Conservative,"- I know you asked about conservatives but there's a decent overlap: Republicans should find, cultivate, and run minority candidates that will appeal to the shallow diversity voters.  - Republicans should embrace some entitlements for minorities to attract their votes. Instead of pretending to focus on the free market, promote things that will help their communities.   - Conservatives should be ashamed for giving into the homosexual agenda by now condoning it.  &gt; I don't like Trump, overall. ...  I don't think that's really unpopular. I completely agree with you."

Conservative,"cruz called them out during the republican debates. he had the balls to stand up to the media, but the democrats are such fucking cowards who are just happy to get some screen time. no principals or hutzpah."
Conservative,"Kamala sounds like a drunk college chick at the bar that thinks she is so hot, but no one is taking that bitch home."
Conservative,That piece of info killed her chances straight out of the gate
Conservative,Unless they banned a gay wedding. That's a no no.
Conservative,See ya. Imagine having to listen to that horrendous voice for 4 years?
Conservative,"&gt; disallowing all illegals here from ever voting in their lifetimes or gaining legal status would have been enough.  Not trying to be condescending, but do you think that would seriously ever happen or be followed?   20 years down the road: ""Racist Republicans are stopping tax paying Latinos from being able to vote. No taxation without representation.""  Never ever compromise with liberals. Reagan did it with amnesty and the congress did it with the Brady Bill. What did we get? Sanctuary cities and the Gun Show ""Loophole"".  They are liars and snakes."
democrats,He's a salesman.  He sells.   It's all that he is good at.          It matters to him not at all if he is selling reality or bullshit.          He is a salesman. He sells.   It's *all* that he is good at.  
Conservative,It is for sure. I think who ever is in charge listens to what the people actually want to watch. Maybe I'm biased but as an MMA fan I love the coverage fox gives the UFC and I think a ton of other people do too. I could go on and on about it but yea nearly every aspect of fox sports is superior to ESPN. 
Conservative,It’s hard to fathom there is anyone who can say with a straight face that they support any of these people.
Conservative,'member the 90s?'
Conservative,"Really? Do you really have to ask that question? It's relevant because the first amendment guarantees freedom of speech, in case you forgot. "

Conservative,"Johnson can't name a single world leader, and Weld can't keep the message on the qualifications of his own running mate?  Is pot mandatory in the party now?"
Conservative,"You can have me, or even more incompetent version of me who in no way will be able to help the economy recover after the inevitable drop from a presidential assassination so the people who would want it done will lose more in the long run than if they wait for my term to finish &lt;/tinfoil&gt;"
Conservative,"Can’t wait- between these punks and a transgender female shattering the high school softball homerun record, the woke left will be very woke when they see how America comes down on them; this is all part of the Trump pendulum ; exposing the radicalism of the left who is so furious that he’s the president they’re ugly side is rearing in ways never seen.. his victory in 2020 will be the icing on the cake (and I don’t even like the guy, sorry.)."
Republican,damn straight
Conservative,"&gt;I look forward to you telling me how these are totally different circumstances.  ok, here goes nothing  this is more like a store taking action against a gay couple who comes in every day and yells about how gay they are and how straight people are a bunch of pussies while parading around the store. and its not comparable to banning them either, its comparable to reworking the store in such a way that sane customers can hear a little bit less of the people who are clearly just agitating them on purpose (they still can hear them quite a bit though)  so i disagree with this analogy on both counts"

Liberal,Why are the Stones allowing him to use it would be just as good of a question.  I'd say since he and his ilk are clinging to 'socialism is about entitlement and all Bernie supporters just want free things' it's his dig at that whole narrative that they've spent a long time trying to weave.

Liberal,"Semantics. If someone thinks abortion should be legal no matter what then they are not pro-life. Obviously, that's why 'pro-choice' is a designation in the abortion debate. Notice the downvote I received for claiming to be pro-life? Nevertheless, forcing funeral services for fetuses is about as backwards as legislation can get."

Should I not take anything he says or tweets seriously?  "
Conservative,Betsy Devos is not conservative what are you talking about? She is big government pro micromanage pro common core.      Tom Price absolutely is not a conservative either he was being pushed by GOP leadership for the position. He has a D rating (61%) on conservative review.       Sessions sure he is a good pick but is really the only good pick so far.      Edit: I can see that a lot of people are not able to be objective..
democrats,i don't get it but whatever put donna on blast
Republican,"Romney would NOT beat Hillary.  He is too Bush like, and did not have the Hispanic vote like AT ALL!  She would have tied every single comment and action to Bush and he would have got destroyed.  Plus hes a spineless jelly fish and the media would have eaten him up and spit him out. "
Conservative,H. W Bush and third term FDR would probably disagree with him
Republican,"Some would argue that he is ALREADY in Ukraine, thinking both about the East Ukraine and Crimea."
Conservative,"  The state bureau found they had violated anti-discrimination laws because their shop is not a registered religious institution. They refused service to the couple solely because they were gay.  And the states voters chose to enact Anti-discrimination laws in the provision of goods and services back in 2007 so a stipulation of your business license is to serve all who come in your establishment regardless of race, gender, sex or sexual orientation.

Conservative,It wasn’t a limitless investigation. Many things were blocked from Mueller. Frankly the Ukraine thing is being investigated more fully than anything Mueller did it seems. Let the information come out and let the people decide. Barr can investigate the Russia investigation and Biden while the Dems do their shit. The truth needs to come out in all cases.
Conservative,That ain't gonna happen

My point was that unless there is a video of it happening which somehow survived up to today, or Trump is recorded somewhere say it happened, etc, I doubt there is any way to back her claim up, without more women coming out and saying they were raped by him. I'm not saying to ignore this and not look into it, I think we should. I'm saying I doubt anything will come of it. "

Republican,Maybe it's because one of the libertarian candidates did a strip tease on stage this year.
Conservative,"After observing actual hard working people in construction, utility and energy fields- I typically see wrangler jeans about eight times out of ten.  So I don't see that really affecting responsible hard working people."
Republican,I agree with you on those two issue and I think most Americans do too. I think the Republican party is a point where they can either move toward the middle on those issues or America will pass them by.    You're right it's about coming together and finding common ground on areas such as pro-choice/pro-life. 
Conservative,Because making rules that only apply to communities with speech you disagree with is immoral. I'm not saying they're not allowed to do it and I'm not saying it'll take less than a few years for the free market to punish them. But if you have a community that works as a commons for public discourse than you have a moral duty to make the same rules for all groups who use that platform.
Republican,I certainly hope so
democrats,You can also make an argument that they are providing an alternative perspective to what students were taught in earlier education and exposed to in media. 
Conservative,"Ok, bravo for Trump making some kind of deal to keep 1000 of the Carrier jobs in the US.  I like the reality of keeping good paying jobs here, as I think most people would. But...does this not bother anyone else in some ways?  Trump singled out this company and apparently struck some kind of deal. We don't really know the details. Isn't this a strange situation though?  When was the last time a President intervened in the decisions of a company?  Does this kind of activity not strike anyone else as meddling in the company's decisions?    Is he going to do this with all companies and that decide manufacturing can be done cheaper overseas?  Is there a systematic framework around this or will he just pick on companies who's employees happened to capture and post on Facebook the video of an announcement?  Don't get me wrong. To reiterate, I think the outcome sounds good. I'm just a little concerned about the means too. I'm all in favor of keeping manufacturing and other jobs in the US. Shit.. I work in IT, and there are plenty of examples of offshoring my role. But this still raises a concern for me in a way. Carrier was a poster child because it was internet infamous for making this decision.  He intervened in their business decisions. We don't know  the details of the kinds of carrot/stick used to affect a change in their decision, and we don't know if he will target other businesses, or how he'll decide which to target.   I don't know, something. About this just raises some red flags for me. "

Conservative,"You're overstating it.  If Donald Trump wanted more of a photo-op, he would have brought more members of the media, even sympathetic media, like Fox News and the Washington Times.  But there's not a lot out there.  He wants goodwill from the American people, but he's clearly doing it for the troops, when he could have been with his family."
Conservative,"Ok so how much did Google, Facebook, and Twitter manipulations influence the election in favor of Hillary?

If our central motivating causes are justice and to restore economic vitality to the middle class, we have to acknowledge both that we are not our true enemy and that some of us need more help than others.  The Third Way Democrats made a mistake in neglecting Labor, we shouldn't mirror that mistake going forward by neglecting long standing injustices.

Conservative,"the logic seems to be based on their strawmen/stereotyped view of liberals and democrats that behave like a pack of starving wolves, ready to tear up anything they see. When the reality is the people they see behaving that way have been either taken out of context, re badly generalized, are trolls/baits, or are a small noisy minority. When the reality is the only people who would reject this supposed scenario are people already seen as bad (i.e., terfs/radfems) or if he legit was doing it in a way that screamed faking it. and even then people would still try to respect the name change and pronouns Donna Trump would use.  It's a joke that acts as kindling to whatever they're thinking."

It's really amazing.  Before the election, the left and the Democratic Party seemed unstoppable next to the incompetent and in-fighting GOP.  But somehow things have been completely flipped upside down, the GOP is the unified party, and the Dems just can't put their shoes on right and do anything reasonable now."

I guess it depends if you believe the US should incentivize companies to stay, and try to ensure American workers keep their jobs, or if they should just sign free trade agreements and let them just dodge taxes and run off to foreign countries.  Fox reported that Trump and Pence are moving on at least another dozen companies who planned to offshore, including Nabisco.

Conservative,"Trump's polling in the upper 30's and low 40's.  It's too early to say really how much influence he has, or fault anyway.  He's also got the benefit of Hillary, who is objectively the worst Democratic candidate since at least Dukakis (and that's probably not fair to Dukakis).  Her unfavorables are historically horrible, and would be much more of an issue if not for Trump's own horrible unfavorables.   Otherwise, totally agree the electoral map favors the Democrats.  That has a lot to do with the overall minority voter percentage increase too, not just north-south migration.  Republicans get the overall lions share of white voters, it's the minorities Democrats win on.  Trump's liberal positions certainly don't help him down south either.  "

Or let me break it down for you even more, as the top vote getter (popular vote), he won the least percentage of votes than anyone since Reagan in 1968..      &gt;So instead of getting off your high horse, you're probably going to vote for the open border pro-choice babbling druggie instead.      I will vote my conscience on election day just as I do every single time I vote. That concept maybe a little foreign to you cultists. But if you really must know, no I will not be voting for a pseudo libertarian. At the same time  as I've  said numerous times over the past couple months, Trump does not have my vote by default.

Conservative,"the_Donald is **full of liberals** (and worse), many of whom are so ridiculous **even the progressives rejected them.** You know, if you're progressive, you have to carefully be a coward about when and how you let your prejudice, bigotry, and outright racism show. You know, coded language, two-faced obsequiousness to those in ""victim groups"", etc.  Hasn't anyone else here noticed the history of in-fighting on the Left? The only thing that unites them is the **mandatory progressive prejudice against their enemy groups.**  With so many Leftist liberals gravitating to Trump, the progressive fanatics were doubly outraged. They use the same tactics against each other.  Now, if they were to attempt that in conservative, Republican, christian, capitalist, and pro-life subreddits, they wouldn't find it so easy to find excuses to do make these openly illiberal mistakes.  They will *have* to step over yet another line that shows them to be hypocrite control freaks.  And, **that will be hilarious.**  Reddit is of very limited value in the grand scheme of things. It can and should be replaced by superior competition (some conservative developers need to get on that. Reddit's design has some very stupid flaws!)  We should hope they are stupid enough to keep giving us a track record of censorship, illiberalism, hypocrisy, prejudice, bigotry, open hate, inconsistent positions and statements, support for criminality and depravity, other behaviors destructive to civil society, and their foolishly blatant denials of all these things.  Now is actually a great time to help ensure more people become conservative, and the Left will help us do it.  Trump may end up making his ""movement's"" liberal Republican position so tainted that him and his followers move people toward actual conservatism. Some are already there. Same thing happened to me years ago, even though my own unrealistically liberal position on the Iraq War was wrong on key points due to simple ignorance about Saddam's misdeeds and the German chemical factories the media didn't talk about. Hypocrisy of Leftists made me independent, and progressives and especially education made me conservative.  Real conservatives may gain from all this in the future, but who knows?  EDIT: Look! At least one centipede reacted to criticism like a progressive."

When I mentioned that after three months I hadn't gotten over my anger about what was done to me because a worthless c*nt fucked up and she walked away with no injuries while I am fucked up for life I was told that I needed to forgive that woman and to move on and forget about it.  He also told me that my anger was in the wrong place that I should give consideration for the hell she's going through because she nearly killed me.    I told him that for him to be that stupid and the head of HR proved that HR was a completely useless department and that she could be locked away in the deepest darkest dungeon with her clit and nipples sliced off with a razor blade followed by her fingers and toes and left to slowly die over a long period, she'd still get off too easily.  So yes, I completely understand where these students are coming from and the administrators are completely 100% in the wrong."

Conservative,Sites are already banned even now under US control. Isis sites are banned. Child porn is banned. Around the world American companies force Torrent sites to be banned. This is the biggest red herring i have ever seen. It does not matter who owns ICANN and the idea that one country should control the naming rights is wrong. There should be an international treaty set up so that an independent body owns them free of control from anyone.

If she wins, Hillary will sign the TPP before this time next year.   If she wins Hillary will find excuses to prevent a public option because her Corporate masters will not allow it.   If she wins, Hillary will do _NOTHING_ to address Citizens United because her Corporate masters will not allow it.  If she wins, Hillary will do nothing to address overreach by the Intelligence community and will further punish whistleblowers like Edward Snowden.   I refuse to compromise my principles and what LITTLE say that I have in my government and how I am bring increasingly RULED by a ruling class by voting for someone who I know is corrupt.

Identitarianism is the prioritization of social identity, regardless of political persuasion. Thus, the Alt-Right promotes White Identity and White Nationalism.  Personally I don't care care for their message but I completely disagree with the quarantine. I believe Internet forums should be robust bastions of free speech.

Conservative,"The only solution is to move all services to the private sector.  In the few cases where government employees DO have performance incentives, the  results were even more disastrous.  For example, the Veterans Administration paid huge bonuses to clear waiting lists while leaving sick people to die. "
Conservative,"That’s only if they work more than the expected 50 hours to do their job. It’s like most of us with salaried jobs, the more hours you work the less you make per hour but the paycheck is still the same amount. But according the the Washington Post’s article they’ll be making at least $42k/year with an expected work week of 50 hours over 6 days.   If you do the math with the basic assumptions they’re being paid on a biweekly basis for 26 pay periods in a year.   $42000 / 26 = $1615.38  $1615.38 / 100 hours (50 hrs x 2 weeks) = $16.15/hr  Thats better than before but is also before taxes. It’s also not bad pay wise. I remember in college making $16/hr and living fairly comfortably for a full time student and full time employee."

Conservative,"&gt; If you move, change occupations, or change your hair color they'll be a note in a file by the end of the week.   Uh, not quite that extreme. But in theory it is a combination of more active community policing, relying on tips from busybody old ladies with nothing better to do, and sort of letting organized crime keep their crime organized. The more important aspect is the justice system here in Japan has a 99% conviction rate, rather than letting half of the clearly guilty people free on some legal technicality like in the USA.   Then it becomes a moral question. If maybe more innocent people are jailed, but far fewer innocent people are victimized by violent crime, is that a net benefit to society? I hate to say yes, but I can walk down a dark alley at 2AM in any major city in Japan and not worry about getting robbed or killed."

Obviously we shouldn't be chemically castrating children, but this title may be a bit misleading to people that aren't aware of the above. The big problem isn't that this isn't reversible -- it is. The problem is that you're fucking up natural puberty. Reversing castration isn't going to make you 14 again."

Conservative,"I know this is only for one university, but my university includes American History Pre-1877 and Post 1877 in the general education requirements, meaning that all students (including History majors) must take those two classes.   While true that American History isn't explicitly listed under History degree requirements, I would wager that it is included in general education."
democrats,I was thinking the same thing earlier today.
Conservative,That's what suspected means. None of the point of view characters were in the know. It's also quite possible Loras' love was one sided.   But yeah it was fairly likely.
Liberal,Bill Maher is also a smug jerk that is way too often wrong. He is part of the outrage culture.
Republican,"Populists, conservatives, corporatists, and small L libertarians.  Though the corporatists are a small minority they are running the party, but only because they've pretended to represent the other factions - and now the other factions are finally beginning to wake up to the fact that the corporatists don't represent them, don't want to, and will do anything they can to prevent people who do from being elected.  Unfortunately, the populists are easily led, so the corporatists got them to go with their backup plan if one of their own couldn't be the nominee: Trump.  He's one of them, they just don't control them - but they're OK with that, because Hillary is almost as good for them as one of theirs."

Conservative,"This is a valid concern for sure, but it doesn’t change the fact that those people identify as women. I mean, how much glory is there in being a man beating women in sports really? Apart from the media glorifying it, at the end of the day the athletes know what’s actually happening. It’s not like they’re going to turn around after becoming a top female athlete and decide they are actually a man. If you’re willing to change your gender just to be a more well known athlete then damn, that’s pretty fucking sad. But if you consider yourself a woman and look like a woman, it would only be MORE weird to have you playing with men imo. Gender in general is just a really complex issue and something our society isn’t ready to address in such a dramatic way."

Conservative,"It was brief because that’s what happened. Mexico lost California and a chunk of the Western states to the USA. I’m not saying it was bad or good, but that’s what happened.  And in my lifetime, politics in California has swung around quite a bit. Pete Wilson was a hard line conservative, anti-immigrant Governor in the 90s, who’s probably be right at home in this subreddit. Hell, Reagan was Governor here. The last Governor, Jerry Brown pretty much won the first time, because no one wanted to run. Our new guy, Newsome, is gunning for the Presidency, whether we like or not. Politics and People change.   How do you propose we fix California? Because as a local, I’d honestly love to hear them. No hate, let’s talk policy."

Conservative,"I have to say, I've been following the election with bated breath from the UK, and whilst it has to be said there are some issues with a Trump presidency, it would be far better than a Clinton one. I've always felt she was a crusader, and a dangerous war hungry one at that.   The series of serious issues that have arisen since the wiki dumps is just unbelievable, and whilst I realise that there has been a lot of cover-ups, and that the media is point blank refusing to cover this - even in the UK, I find it hard to understand why anyone would support her, never mind why she's not been forced out of the race completely.   It seems like the whole setup is being created to ensure Trump gets in, with the hope that he won't be able to repair any current damage allowing the democrats to fingerprint for the next term, with a palatable candidate. "
Conservative,"Like a mama bear and her cubs, you never get in beteeen the Left and its vote fodder."
Conservative,"opinions vary. Khan was the first one to make comments against Trump. Downside to doing that is that Trump doesn't hold back and isn't politically correct and will fire back.

Conservative,"No, he might be saying ""talk later"" but he quiet clearly said ""Illegals won't be given citizenship unless they go back home first, and wait in line."""
Conservative,"As for religion. Japan is very, justifiably worried about murderous death cults. The remaining offshoots of the cult who did the sarin gas attack *Aum Shinrikyo* are still subject to heavy surveillance today. And **they should be, because they are a religious death cult with a history of murdering people and a massive terrorist chemical weapons attack**. Not every member was part of the special group that engaged in terrorism and murders. Most were nice people individually, but that does not mean I want the Japanese police to stop watching them like hawks.  Why should it be different if the murderous death cult with a history of thousands of terrorist attacks has hundreds of millions of members worldwide? A death cult is a death cult. I don't think the Founders were thinking about freedom to practice a religion that says ""Kill everyone else""."
Liberal,"Bill Maher may be a smug, dick, but he is 100% right. Liberals try too hard not to hurt anyone's feelings. It gets annoying. They need to not beat around the bush. "
Liberal,"What? You may be mistaking talk show prowness with smugness. Maher often admits he doesn't know enough about an issue to have an opinion, attacks phony liberalism and most importantly allows qualified representatives from the other side propose their argument with reasonable time. We need more platforms like Real Time (i.e. places where people can argue ideologies and laugh and enjoy themselves at the same time)."

He was the smartest man I know and he was offered a job to be an anthropology professor at UCLA.  Straight white men are people too!!!!    I'm drunk and rambling but this is all so frustrating.  This hyphenated American shit is killing out country.    I am not a Hispanic American.  My adopted father was not a European American.  We were both proud Americans no pre face necessary  Sorry for my drunken rant I'm just frustrated.  By Republicans who feel the need to reinforce their beliefs by pointing out minorities are behind them (especially on TD) and the left who take every minority vote for granted.    TLDR wether you're gay, son of inmigrants like myself or a straight white male none of these things should define you.  We're American's first and everyone should have a say without being judged for whatever race/gender/sexuality they are   **SPEZ/EDIT**  I'm drunk and going all over the place with this but please my fellow conservatives tell me this post on TD isn't us  ---""We most certainly do ban people who speak counter to our culture. But we have always done that; it is an agreement you tacitly enter into with us by using our subreddit.  But Reddit as a whole has no disclaimer. This change is analogous to agreeing to play a game by a certain set of rules, then angrily attempting to change the rules after-the-fact when someone beats you by playing according to the rules. It is not in the spirit of fairness or of free discourse, especially for a site that was conceived as a ""bastion of truth on the Internet""---  In other words the TD is mad that they're being censored on a privately owned website when they admit to doing it themselves on their sub that said corporation allows to exist  Call me old fashioned but TD's community response to this situation is some grade A liberal BS to me.   If our values demand privatized health care and schools and damn near everything then why the hell are we making such a big deal out of an internet forum and acting like a bunch of entitled democrats over it?  It's hypocritical on our part.  Reddit is a privately owned company they can do whatever the hell they want.   Stop acting like whiney Bernie worshippers over it"

Much of Islam is concerned with what nonMoslems must do and not do if they are to be allowed to COEXIST with Moslems and not be blown apart at the Boston Marathon Massacre.   The fundamental problem with Islam is its demand nonbelievers conform to the twisted worldview of ancient desert lunatics. It is not enough for Moslems to wallow in the self pity, self loathing and self righteousness of Islam. Moslems must also worry their bigoted souls over dog walkers in foreign lands. Moslems feel they must tell the entire world what to write, what cartoons people can draw, what food to eat, what drink to not drink. They need to be disabused of this notion."

Republican,"Here is the problem...  Democrats/Liberals/Progressives believe that government is an effective tool to improve the lives of citizens.  While many acknowledge there is some wasteful spending, by and large the belief is that on a whole a large government is a good as it can (through taxes) ""level the playing field"" so everyone can win.  Likewise, this group believes that comprehesive regulation helps society by preventing abuse.  In short, a strong regulated society is more important than individual liberty.  Republicans/Conservatives/Libertarians beieve that government is necessary tool to provide for common defense and ensure basic rights.  Most believe that government is much to large and regulation stifles individualism, capitalism, and freedom.  This group believes that succes is achievable by hard work and a level playing field guarentees that the strong will achieve.  In short, individual liberty is more important than collective equality.  As a result, the problem is really that the concept of ""working with Democrats"" is fundamentally flawed.  If one side (democrats) believe in growing government and one side (republicans) believe in shrinking government, then a compromise is to keep it exactly the same.    When someone like Baker (or anyone else accused of being a RINO) makes a deal to grow the government, spend more, regulate more, or otherwise interfere with individual liberty what they are really doing is just allowing Democrats to gain at a slower rate.  (Growth of 2% a year means that government is twice as large every 35 years thanks to compounding).  If you really seek compromise, find Democrats who are willing to balance growth with cuts; eliminate regulations when adding new ones; and repeal laws when writing new ones - then I think you will find lots of Republicans willing to meet you half way.  Until then, Republicans who act like Democrat-lite will be branded RINOs."

democrats,Couldn't have said it any better! Trump is mental and they're willing to believe everything he says even to the point of being totally unamerican about it. Trump in any normal situation wouldn't be given a security clearance based on his family ties to Russia alone and the Republicans want to elect him to office? They dare have the gal to talk about Clinton and her private emails being hacked?

Conservative,"I can totally understand someone thinking Trump is terrible and disliking him (even as a strong Trump supporter).

This smug condescension isnt' even earned, because it is apparent that neither understands what they're talkign about. More, they frame a thing (like microaggressions) in a very particular way and then laugh it off.   Some guy in the south bronx? Well ask him about corn subsidies and he also won't give a shit, at all. Guess what, different people have different issues to deal with in their lives and we all have a duty as liberals to seek out injustice *in all its forms* and help redress it.  With this idiot movement over the last year among old, dated left wingers, they lose their grasp on the problem by falling back on the idea that people need to ""toughen up"" or something. Just soak up the abuse, and do so quietly, and dare you ever speak out against it well that's just a problem dontchaknow.   I generally, like 99% of the time, like Maher. I like most of his style.

Conservative,"Liberals are not economic leftists. Just because American social liberals and ""progressives"" want to keep a basic welfare state in place doesn't make them anti-capitalists. Liberals want to very lightly regulate capitalism while supporting a private property based market economy and basic social safety net. Socialists want to completely abolish private property and capitalism and replace it with worker/public ownership and control of the means of production. Socialism isn't heavily regulated capitalism and a robust social safety net like Bernie wants. Socialists are not ""extreme liberals."" The definition of socialism is an economic system of public/worker ownership and control of the means of production and the complete abolition of private property (private property meaning factories, mines, mills and plants, not personal property like houses, cars, and clothing.) Scandinavian and Western European countries are not socialist, they're social democratic. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are considered to be right wing capitalist imperialists by actual socialists. Seriously, it doesn't reflect well on the American right wing when they can't even understand the objective political spectrum. The Democratic Party is roughly analogous to the British Conservative Party in economic policy. There are no actual socialists in the American government. Obama supports free trade deals like the TPP, finalized Bush's tax cuts on the rich, has deported more people than any president, and equated communists with ISIS in his most recent speech. They may support trans people using whatever bathroom they want and be pro-feminist, but they're an enthusiastically capitalist party."

I listened to that debate on the way home from work and it really cemented to me just how far left he's gone. He's getting a bit wacky.  edit: I do actually agree with his point towards the end where he said ""just get over it if someone says X racist/sexist remark, who cares"" but if it happens over and over it becomes aggravating, and it was fairly eye opening for me. He has some good points, I just disagree with him philosophically on a lot of his new points. But he's fairly well thought out on his points."

Conservative,"Months ago Trump supporters worried that a third-party Libertarian candidate might steal conservative votes away from Trump and give the White House to Clinton. On the other hand, libertarians worried that the influx of conservatives to the LP after Ted Cruz dropping out will make them just another bunch of right-winger. Guess what, Johnson's now *pandering to the Left* with regards to social issues, even though he is the most fiscally conservative candidate.   If you are a third-party candidate you'd want to gain votes from both the Left and the Right...which means compromising on certain issues, especially controversial ones. As much as I don't like it, Johnson's strategy is fine to me if it means drawing votes away from Hillary as well as from Trump. There's a possibility that he'll reach 15% and get into the debate stage because he's capitalizing on the populace's disdain of both major candidates."

He's also been a registered Democrat. Even in this election he said the no fly list should be able to take away your gun ownership rights which is ridiculous and completely unconstitutional. His tax plan, which will never pass because it is too ridiculous for Republicans to even consider doing so, would also skyrocket the national debt faster than Bush or Obama ever did."
Conservative,I'm all for it
Conservative,I know few human beings that are privately as revolting as Trump is publicly.

Conservative,I’m just curious where she plans on going.
Republican,"&gt; It's not like you can hit a button and suddenly everyone will go back to caring about free markets, free people, and the Constitution. The GOP is in its current mess because this (Trump) is what the voters want...  Actually the GOP is in its current mess because for most of the last three decades, it thought it could ignore its voters and sell out their interests to curry favor with its big corporate donors, without consequence.  The voters tried to get the party to represent them in 2010, 2012, and 2014, and were vigorously stomped on by the Party Establishment for their efforts.  **That's** why the GOP is in its current mess."
Conservative,"That is actually an interesting analogy, and definitely a more substantial explanation than any of my liberal friends could provide. But I could argue that the issue is the interpretation of the phrase. In the above analogy, ""All lives matter"" is be being interpreted as a dismissal of the complaint ""Black lives matter too"". On the other hand myself, and I presume many others, are using the phrase in the context of an acknowledgement and expansion of the given complaint to be inclusive of everyone. In other words, yes I believe that black lives matter, and that true injustices to the black community should be addressed, because I believe that all lives matter and all injustices should be addressed. So in the dinner analogy, I would be stating that ""we all need butter"" and then suggesting that we proceed to pass the butter around so that everyone who is lacking butter could have some, including the person who originally complained about lacking butter, thus addressing his lack thereof while also being inclusive of everyone else who may be lacking butter."
Conservative,"&gt; Being Conservative, even Republican, doesn't have shit to do with being white.  I mean you're kinda right, it just so happens 95% of conservatives/republicans are white.  &gt; More Republicans like Ryan or McCain, and fewer ""Conservatives"" like Trump with white nativist followers like you? Sounds like a winner.  I couldn't agree more, shame the voter base chose differently and will probably choose differently for the foreseeable future. Sadly life doesn't give you what you want all the time. I care about the SCOTUS nominations a hell of a lot more then I care about ONE politician. But anyways, 0% chance Cruz ever gets the nomination.    &gt; I wish you and your ilk would leave /r/Conservative and go populate /r/altright where you belong.  You belong here /r/TedCruz/"

Conservative,If you think so it's probably because you're not a university professor and thus don't know what the shit you're talking about.
Liberal,"And that is where you lose me entirely. The campus culture you describe does not exist, at all. It's a handy fiction invented for the soul purpose of creating something to be angry at.   Very few people are """"""demanding"""""" (examine your language here) trigger warnings. Many people are asking for them should the topic of the day be something extreme.  It is common, normal, and absolutely typical to provide content outlines both in the syllabus AND prior to class. I started university in 1999, and every single time we were going to deal with something really heavy we'd get a short ""hey guys todays topic is: thing, please be advised""  And *that was the end of it.*  Microaggressions.

Now provide me an argument for the theory, then provide me an argument against the theory. "
Liberal,"I agree generally that we need more strong, aggressive liberals who will stand up to Republicans and actually do what we elect them to do.  I am also staunchly for free speech and started a free speech group at my college, but I think people place a lot of blame on political correctness that's not merited. Political correctness is just the notion that you should consider other people's feelings when deciding what terminology you use to discuss them, and I have no problem with that. What I do have a problem with is people trying to shut down debate because it hurts their feelings, which happens on both sides. The recent news that conservative groups are keeping lists of professors who hold 'left-wing' views and trying to get them fired is a good example. We just need to do a better job of teaching people from a young age that your opinions are not safe from criticism and inquiry. "

Jill Stein probably also believes a recount would be damaging to the democrats hence why she did it.  Hillary only appeared to get involved to turn conservatives against it to cover her ass as that is the only logical reason why she would be willing to take the political beating she is about to get for touching it.

Conservative,does Harris have gray eyes?
Republican,"I see where the example presents a particularly extreme example. My challenge (which I think mirrors Gary's challenge) is I don't see how you allow that narrow discrimination without opening the door for general discrimination. Recognizing that there weren't equal rights, the Civil Rights Act was passed ""giving all Americans the right to be served in facilities which are open to the public—hotels, restaurants, theaters, retail stores, and similar establishments"". I agree with that rule and don't see how exceptions can be carved out without totally gutting the entire law. I guess the problem arises when the First Amendment rights of the server are at odds with the servee. I'd rather guarantee the rights of the servee even where it threatens the server than vice versa. Part of that is probably a historical bias given our country didn't do a very good job protecting the rights of the servee for a long time. I guess at the end of the day I'm sacrificing the 1 in a billion (if not less) scenario for what was an for a long time a source of discrimination for millions of people: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_antisemitism_in_the_United_States  "

If one looks at the original intent of the 2nd Amendment as written by Madison before shortened for brevity when published, then this will be held as constitutional in court. Scalia was well aware of the original intent since he supposedly was an originalist, but he let his political views over ride that in Heller and twisted himself into the shape of a pretzel trying to justify not using original intent. When Hillary Clinton puts a new judge on the Supreme Court, Heller will be buried for good one hopes."

Conservative,"I've had family in california since the 1960s, and it's gone downhill at least since the late 80s, and rapidly downhill since the early to mid 90s.  I don't see this ""swing"" back and forth, I see occasional blips on the radar where the decline slows down when there's the rare republican governer, and then resumes its increasing pace after the next election cycle.  The damage done to CA both culturally and economically (yes i know it's full of rich people, but the income disparity there is some of the worst in the nation), is not going to be undone by one Conservative governer being brought in, and the idea that they'd vote in even ONE at this point seems far fetched, let alone 2 or 3 in a row, in addition to more conservative representatives and mayors.  I don't see a fix for CA, or I'd have proposed one, that's why I think we cut out the tumor and move on without them.  Many tech corporations will leave (and are already purchasing land and building facilities elsewhere), a new movie production epicenter is already emerging in Georgia.  Removing the outsized influence CA has over the rest of the nation would go a long way, even if it negatively effects the conservative minority (extreme minority) in that state."

Seeing as how the Democrats seem to double down on progressivism at times, libertarians and classic liberals are really at a loss as to which party to vote for. If you ask me, the Republican Party has more space for these people than the Democrats do with their direction. These are people who care more about freedom, not about ""progress"" for the sake of it."
Conservative,"The earlier the better obviously. As more time progress it becomes more unethical.   At some time, the fetus/child becomes able to feel pain. I would say as long as it's done well ahead of that point, then abortion is acceptable.   There is plenty of people not ready/fit to be a parent. To have the option of abortion in society is very useful and even a human tool.   Late term abortion. Cruel and unethical. At least if you ask me(ethics and morals becomes subjective at some point)"
Liberal,"But you're equating a clump of cells with a decades-old human being with an established life. Plus, you have no way of knowing how the 'baby' came to exist and whether or not it's a danger to the mother or it's in danger of dying itself.  Roe v. Wade wasn't passed because the public decided it loved abortion, it passed because we realized that we didn't have enough information to legislate every circumstance and that we trusted women and their doctors to make an informed decision.

Conservative,"&gt; Here is the most important benefit of this broad and aggressive approach to the president's defense: in confronting all those who have ceaselessly sought to reverse the 2016 election, President Trump's legal team this time will have a critical tool thus far denied them: the power to subpoena any and all persons, including all those who were elbow-deep in the Russia collusion hoax.  Unlike during the feeble and tedious investigation conducted by the Washington elite's chosen operative, Robert Mueller, every single such person will be sworn and aggressively, publicly interrogated under penalty of perjury, by formidable trial counsel.  &gt; What the anti-democratic authors of this latest putsch attempt failed to realize — in their fury of blind hatred — is that the Republican Senate majority will be in command of the scope and duration of the trial and that the truth-revealing power of the subpoena, followed by public testimony under oath, is the surest route to exposing lies and crimes."

Conservative,"This isn’t something that’s necessarily all marbles in the “wrong” bag or in the “right” bag. There’s aspects of this that are ridiculous, and some that arent.   Getting hormone therapy or reassignment surgery on a three year old is obviously wrong. Telling them that they’re a girl when they’re a boy or vice versa can potentially have harmful effects, we don’t know much about it because that’d be difficult to ethically study.   On the other hand, if your kid asks to wear a dress or play with “boy” toys or wear ribbons in their hair, there’s no inherent, fundamental harm in that.   You cant even argue that a boy wearing a skirt at school can be harmed by others ridiculing him because the root problem there is people needing to be taught not to judge on something so irrelevant."
Conservative,"I think it's bullshit a sub that does not allow any dissent(the definition of a safe space) has been allowed to be at the top of all for the better part of a year.  They function like a private community while also using vote manipulation to make everyone on Reddit see it and then claim political persecution when they are reprimanded.  If they want to be considered a political discussion then they should allow discussion, if they want to be a meme shit ground then they should function that way and not expect any political protection.  They can't have the best of both worlds.  I can post in this sub despite the fact that I am a die hard liberal and yet I can still have a meaningful conversation while not agreeing with people on ideology.  I can't do the same in t_d.  I participated in s4p and it was used for political organization, a meaningful useful goal, T_d has been participated in some of that but to say that is the main focus of the sub is asinine. T_d seems to exist to piss off people who disagree with them and to ignore any flaws in their candidate.  Basically T_d is the ultimate safe space hugbox and the fact that free speech is banned there it gives me nothing but joy to see them now complaining that they don't have free speech because I now have the option to ignore their inane bullshit from my feed.

It seems that diplomacy was holding the military back.  &gt; I'm told by a former senior government official who has participated in rescue discussions like the ones Team Obama had (or should have had) on Sept. 11, 2012 that it's the Secretary of State's job to secure permission from the country in question (here Libya) for our military to enter its territory. Alternatively, it is her job to decide not to obtain permission and simply act. Until the Secretary of State does one or the other, apparently the military can't proceed.  &gt; If this is true, then the most likely explanation for why the military didn't deploy, as Secretary of Defense Panetta had ordered, is that Hillary Clinton didn't obtain timely permission and didn't authorize the military to proceed without it - the obvious thing for her to have done, given that American lives were at stake."

How is this not free-market capitalism applied?  As a student if you feel that the Universities opinions are counter enough to your own you are free to leave the University for another institution, and also completely free to leave University entirely.  You may have resigned from the SGA, but you seem to still be at the University, and therefore remain bound by their rules, and therefore accepting their rules.  You probably are doing this because you feel that the degree that you will get from them is worth accepting their decision in this and other matters.  This is called Capitalism.

Unless you can show a connection through motive, you're making a ridiculous claim that holds no water.  ""Christian Terrorism"" is not a thing in the United States.  Perhaps somewhere in Africa there are Christians and Muslims fighting with both sides doing it in the name of their religions, but that's simply not happening in Western societies.

And those values and ideals are those of *liberal* democracy.  Constantly striving to make it a more perfect union.  Conservatives are indeed having whiplash. Because they are waking up to the reality that their myths they have sold themselves on are crumbling.   The American spirit is being reasserted on its real, authentic terms. That being that we are stronger *together*.  Always have been."
Conservative,This is some T_D level bullshit.  This sub might turn into trash soon
Conservative,Biden has not looked all that good so far tonight...
Conservative,I think politics is a default sub. New users will get exposure to it and not even perceive of a different voice to be considered. It's a dangerous environment for critical thinking honestly. 
Conservative,The really sad thing is that the SDR's ( Self Destructive Republicans ) will do exactly what the democrats say.
Conservative,Mmm... more.
Conservative,"Existence of the Deep State used to be just a ""conspiracy theory"" on the right. Now MSM  outlets like the NYT. MSNBC and tools like Brennan are publicly acknowledging its existence and extolling the virtue of their actions. Wouldn't it be neat if the Durham investigation resulted in some of these elites ending up behind bars?"
Republican,"I'm somewhat jaded, but I must admit this was a pretty funny video. Those of us of a certain age remember ""The Manchurian Candidate""."
democrats,"On the Dem subreddit at least, have the name of the candidate upfront and capitalised."
Conservative,Hahaha economically centrist? They advocate for taxing da juan pacent at 70-99%
Republican,I am not voting for Donald Trump. I am voting against Hilary Clinton.
democrats,"The economy is doing better than Mitt Romney promised in his bid in 2012 claiming Obama mishandled the recovery.    So, no, we're not starting only from 2008 if we're going to talk about this in the new context you want to. We're talking about it from the objective perspective of the person who was his political opponent who wasn't satisfied with the amount of recovery up to 2012 and gave his preferred solution.    And Obama surpassed that metric.    "
Liberal,"I didn't want to pay for health insurance because I am young and invincible, and now I have to. Thanks Obama. "
Conservative,citation please.
Conservative,"the only heads exploding are radfems and terfs, and we'd very much like them gone, thanks."
Republican,"&gt; I agree with that rule and don't see how exceptions can be carved out without totally gutting the entire law.  I think it's simple.  If it's clear that something violates a known religious belief... it's clear that it does so.  If someone is creating some false belief in order to deny service, then a case can be made.  But let's go to the obvious example ... the Christian baker.  The Christian baker will sell cookies, donuts etc... to all customers regardless.  He or she does not discriminate here.  However, when the gay couple comes to the baker and says, ""We are having a gay wedding and want you to make our cake..."" well, there's certainly scripture that backs up the baker's case that PARTICIPATING in a wedding by making the cake violates the baker's beliefs.  And that's what we have allowed some states to stomp on.  &gt; I guess the problem arises when the First Amendment rights of the server are at odds with the servee.   If someone went to an OB and demanded and abortion and the doctor did not do those because she was a Christian ... should she be forced to perform one just because she can?  "

Liberal,"I don't disagree that we need to focus on the benefits that the Democratic party proposes for everyone, but if putting aside ""identity politics"" means that minority communities have to sit back and enjoy no progress on their personal issues in the meantime, then he's right to be criticized.    It is a fact that our current system is one of entrenched white male supremacy.  If you're a woman, your rights to health care are threatened.  If you're black or Hispanic or Muslim, your rights to life, liberty, and security are threatened.  If you're LGBTQ, your right to your identity is threatened.  And if you're not a white male, your right to vote is being systematically stripped away.  We cannot leave behind these vital and growing parts of the Democratic coalition in the name of reassuring the white male working class voter that we're on their side against ""those people"" in the same way Trump just did.  Even if we win with that strategy, we lose."

Conservative,"it does highlight Obama's defeatist attitude though.  There's nothing Trump did here that's revolutionary, which is what the radical Obama would have tried to imagine. Instead Trump just went old school, down and dirty deal making.  They call him a bafoon, but really he's just practical and not afraid to get his hands a little dirty.  I think he has the potential to be great. And I never thought I'd say that."

I have a 20-year old step daughter who is unable to carry on a conversation with someone who holds an opposing viewpoint. Sometimes even hearing certain words (like the phrase ""white america"" in an Eminem song) sends this whiny millennial know-nothing into bitch mode where she will even break off friendships over someone saying the wrong thing.   I'm not saying this is necessarily common among that age group, but over-sensitive PC culture does exist, and it's actually on both sides of the political spectrum."

Conservative,"It's kind of a half answer given that there weren't really primaries back then but in 1912 Teddy Roosevelt ran third party and split the Republican vote, paving the way for Woodrow Wilson to win.  Concerning Weld, it took all of Gary Johnson's political capital just to get him on the Libertarian ticket in 2016 and that was before he endorsed Hillary."
Conservative,Tbh I'd prefer that if it was flipped around.b
Conservative,"if people who were so stupid and arrogant to think trump would never win want to continue burying their heads in the sand and losing, thats more than fine by me. Its more of the brigading and CTR shilling we care about than some pathetic people who go to the donald just to dump their insecure insults.   really, if you are so sick of the donald and all its toxicity, why do you try to provoke toxic arguments and are so toxic yourself. You'd have to be stupid to think you are being genuine."

Conservative,Can we start by no longer continuing to call anyone who supports Trump a racist member of the alt-right?  I think that's a reasonable first step if you want to keep crossover voters.
Republican,"Yep.  ...but he waited until after she was the Democratic nominee to release this information.  Since Hillary Clinton could execute babies on live tv with an M-16 and neither get indicted, nor lose a single vote from her supporters, this is meaningless."

Liberal,"[Brandeis rescinding their offer to Ayaan Hirsi Ali](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/04/what-was-brandeis-thinking.html) is a good example. They were clearly pressured by on-campus groups to shut down the talk because they didn't agree with her stance... even though she could not be more of a model liberal and her stance on Islam is certainly justified given her horrific experiences and her background as an ex-Muslim. This type of 'keep the bubble intact' mentality is toxic to reasoned debate.   &gt;There is no issue in small liberal arts colleges or on social media.  If you don't think large portions of the internet are designed to regurgitate content that aligns with your preferences, then you don't really understand how marketing and ad revenue works. This is a growing problem. Unless you are browsing the internet anonymously and, to some extent, randomly then you are witnessing a catered experience.  "

Liberal,"&gt;I simply don't care about the environment, it's a non issue to me.  This statement is stupidity in it's purest form.  You're literally saying you don't care about the world you live in... The world you depend on for your own survival.  Do you not realize how absolutely short-sighted that is?  Or do you simply not even care enough about *yourself* to take an interested in your own survival or that of your descendants (should you ever have any)?   &gt;Minimum wage workers are unskilled and lazy.  This statement is completely ignorant.  It shows you don't know a thing about minimum wage work or those that work minimum wage jobs and that you probably haven't even bothered to do any research on the subject.  It's disgusting privilege. Minimum wage jobs aren't easy.  They aren't fun.  Many times they are far more grueling than jobs that pay far more and if a minimum wage worker has a family, they most often have to work extended hours or work multiple jobs.  Minimum wage workers are *far* from lazy, and in many cases they even have college degrees but are unable to find jobs due to the economy.  So no, they aren't *unskilled* either. Just because they don't have skills *you*, in your ignorance, would consider worthwhile doesn't mean they are unskilled.  People like you seem to forget that *someone* has to do minimum wage work.  They are the backbone of our culture that we so often take for granted.  They are the people that serve us our food, that work in our factories, that keep our public spaces clean, that sell us our groceries, and so many other jobs you might consider beneath you, without which our society would turn to garbage.    &gt;I don't think Americans deserve free health care.  That's because you lack empathy for your fellow human beings.  Nobody should have to worry about their health in this day and age.  People shouldn't have to decide between suffering in pain or going bankrupt because medical care costs too much.  You should consider a future when you've been hurt enough to where you can no longer work and therefor require public assistance before you judge ""freeloaders.""  Accidents can happen to anyone, at anytime, and that includes you.    "
Liberal,"You're wrong. This is an incident where kids do something stupid, not an indication of any specific cultural change.   Not to be rude but it sounds like you never went to college, or you were oblivious when you did.  I went for a bachelors at 20, a master at 29, and now a PhD later in my life.   It's exactly the same. Exactly. The same people, the same discussions, the same everything. If anything, college kids now are a lot more emotionally resilient. A LOT more.   People are also more keen on sticking up for themselves.  I do not owe you friendship. I do not owe you my time. I can and will absolutely choose not to freely associate with people who have shitty viewpoints. It isn't my job to teach them, and it isn't my duty to carry all the worlds burdens on my shoulders while I am trying to learn.   I didn't really get that way back when, but I do now.   "
Conservative,"But when they pandered    Dems did not have a real plan -    Simply, ""I'm not him!""        Voters vote for stuff,      For people and ideas -    Not for the default.     I may have listened,    to pandering with substance,    but not, ""I'm not orange.""   "
Conservative,"Why would you assume that s/he is voting for Clinton? It is both moral and objective to be critical of the candidate you are voting for.      Looking at the author's article history, it looks like he is voting for Trump, as he wrote an article on why it is better to vote for Trump as a protest vote rather than a Third party. And quite honestly, I can't see a Clinton supporter writing for the federalist. The word ""federalism"" to Clinton supporters is blasphemic."

Conservative,"I don't see the point in drowning in principle. Is following principle worth poor outcomes, especially on a grand scale? You view it as wrong when rational decisions clash against your values (in this case freedom and self determination.) When you are responsible for the safety and well being of a group, outcome is absolutely necessary to consider. You do understand that behaving rationally is a principle for many, correct? If my well being and the safety of my family can be threatened by someone else's adherence to principles beyond the point of rationality (venturing towards harm) you bet I will be asking for more realistic leadership.  I'm for less government when possible. The problem is I'm not willing to sacrifice reason to principle when the data is pointing the other way. Very few leaders in this country are willing to follow the reasonable approach to problems we face for political reasons, and trying to encourage a more rational process is what I see NDT advocating for. If you believe that we should stick with principles vs. showing flexibility, and If we agree that principles are grounded in values and beliefs, do you agree that NDT approach is actually quite principled since he values data and logic?  You know what politicians think they know best? All of them. Otherwise why would they be trying to legislate? If someone is going to feel that way I sure hope they are grounded in reality and are able to make rational decisions."

Free speech is more than just a law, it's a principle of our society. Universities must be places that foster freedom of expression. SGA has, in effect, told students that if they hold minority opinions then they had better shut up or face the consequences. The place for deciding whether or not the VP should have said what she did is at the ballot box in March, not through mob action.

Why does Ayaan Hirsi Ali have the privilege of being paid to do something when enough of the people she is speaking in front of have already heard her speak, determined she isn't worthwhile, and wanted someone better?  You have managed to argue against yourself. She's a ""model liberal"" but got disinvited. Why?  &gt;This type of 'keep the bubble intact' mentality is toxic to reasoned debate.  Obviously this bubble doesn't exist, if the students were cognizant enough of Ali's words to protest them.  This is where you fail in your thinking. You assume people don't want to be confronted with what they don't like. Rather, they are wise enough to have already heard the argument and found it lacking. No reason to *pay someone to repeat the same tired bullshit*. Ali is also wrong. She's wrong about a lot of things. Were I a Muslim student (I'm not) I would speak out against her.  Why in all of this is the free speech and free association and agency of college students literally always sidelined in favor of people older and within the establishment?  Why is it *always* that we infantilize rather than actually listen to and respond to the points being made by these people?  My theory here is that we blinker ourselves and don't want to pierce our little outrage bubbles and admit that sometimes the students are right and that we're wrong.  &gt;If you don't think large portions of the internet are designed to regurgitate content that aligns with your preferences, then you don't really understand how marketing and ad revenue works. This is a growing problem. Unless you are browsing the internet anonymously and, to some extent, randomly then you are witnessing a catered experience.  This is not what you originally said, this I was responding to:  &gt; I'm all for sensitivity towards those who need it, but I worry that liberal groups have knowingly or sometimes unknowingly co-opted these ideas of sensitivity in order to push ulterior motives through identity politics.  I agree that we are all living in echo chambers but this has always been the case and it's not really anything new.   The worry I have is that now the media is almost entirely entrenched as such and has taken to normalizing extreme shit.

Most social issues like racism are tied to economy because low economic growth causes people to find scapegoats and most often the scapegoat is a minority."
Conservative,"I think the backbone stuff will work itself out eventually, and I do think sender-pays will happen at some point.  There are also forces at work which sidestep a lot of the transit issues, which are the rise of Content Delivery Networks (CDNs).  CDNs are basically enormous, distributed multi-level caches for bulk data on the web.  The so-called 'edge nodes' handle the majority of the traffic, and edge nodes can be located inside ISP networks.  This is already happening, and has been for years.  In the Verizon-Netflix dispute, part of the issue was that Netflix was trying to bootstrap their own CDN, and Verizon was insisting that they pay some maintenance fee for having rack space in the Verizon datacenters, which Netflix didn't want to pay.  So Netflix fell back on Level3 (who also hosts a large CDN, in addition to being a Tier 1 backbone).  Anyway, now everyone has CDNs.  Apple and Google have their own, Netflix and Amazon do, etc.  This means less bulk data transiting the backbone which means less fussing over paying for transit.  As far as having choice of consumer ISPs, I really don't know how we get from here to there.  I strongly suspect that some government intervention (likely at the state and local level) may be required to help get us over the hump and untangle the current mess.  There are a lot of obstacles which have made even the large, well-funded players give up.  (Google, Verizon)  I think the best solution is to treat the last-mile networks like a utility, and allow ISP competition on the back end service.  Sort of like how you generally had choice of long distance carriers on land lines, but local service was a monopoly.  It is relatively simple for ISPs to get started if the last mile infrastructure is already in place.  Plus, there is very little value added in the last mile, since it seems likely we'll end up with fiber everywhere.  The value and choice is all in the back end.  I think that would be an acceptable compromise."

Also, he looked really small and insignificant through the primaries because he refused to engage in the slimines, but maybe that is a strength."

Conservative,"&gt;To conflate the need to prevent potential terrorists from entering our country with the belief that ‘all Muslims’ should be banned is simply wrong and disingenuous. As a reminder, Mr. Trump said: ” “Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life,”   That is the last few lines of [Trump's statement](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-statement-on-preventing-muslim-immigration). The first sentence of that statement is:   &gt;Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on.  Here's [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eh7XaJlvJIg) of him saying those exact words.

It's a fact that Islam in general is racist, sexist, and homophobic, but that doesn't mean there aren't liberal Muslims who believe the same as us.

Liberal,"&gt; You have managed to argue against yourself. She's a ""model liberal"" but got disinvited. Why?  Because ""The Left"" is often regressive and not open to dissenting opinions. The left has a major issue acknowledging the source of radical Islam... which happens to be derived from the religious texts. Many liberals want to put their fingers in their ears and pretend that all religions are the same and that the Quran and Hadiths are not full of inciteful calls to violence (which they are..).   &gt;Ali is also wrong. She's wrong about a lot of things. Were I a Muslim student (I'm not) I would speak out against her.  Such as?.. Maybe bubble is the wrong word in this context, but the goal seems to be to reaffirm the narrative and protect **others** on campus from being exposed to these dissenting opinions.    &gt;Why in all of this is the free speech and free association and agency of college students literally always sidelined in favor of people older and within the establishment?  That's not what happened. A few groups on campus bullied the administration into revoking their invitation by painting themselves as victims.   &gt;Why is it always that we infantilize rather than actually listen to and respond to the points being made by these people?  That's also not what happened. These people were not limited in their speech in any way. There was a concerted effort that actually reached far beyond Brandeis to revoke the invitation. Clearly many Muslim groups did not want to her to speak. If she is wrong, why not let people make up their minds *after* hearing her speak. Again, not everyone on campus had been exposed to her ideas.  &gt;My theory here is that we blinker ourselves and don't want to pierce our little outrage bubbles and admit that sometimes the students are right and that we're wrong.  It certainly wasn't all the students. From what I could tell, a small minority plus bullying from outside groups influenced Brandeis to do so.    &gt;I'm all for sensitivity towards those who need it, but I worry that liberal groups have knowingly or sometimes unknowingly co-opted these ideas of sensitivity in order to push ulterior motives through identity politics.  I stand by this (though I was conflating two points). Again, I think the Brandeis example encapsulates these issues well. This certainly happens on the right as well, but that's to be expected. The left used to be about open and reasoned discussions. It seems to me that it's become prone to ""reaffirming the narrative"" as opposed to challenging it. "
Conservative,"Not sure how unpopular this is but I give Trump a grade of D on his signature issue, immigration. He totally blew it early on by not demanding a Republican controlled congress fund the wall. He caved several times by signing budget deals that didn’t have funding for the wall in it. Even this new money doesn’t fund hardly any new wall, but just replaces some older fence.  Trump has misled his supporters in his tweets on this issue."
Republican,"Wow. I’m just surprised that a journalist actually faced repercussions for reporting propaganda.  My problem with this is that a lot of people are responsible. The editor, probably a senior editor as well, and others approved this story. They ran with it. They didn’t bother to actually research and check up, because it fit the narrative they were pushing.  Then they found out they were wrong, and their magazine looked like a bunch of cunts. So they retracted it, and punished the lowest-ranking person they could. They didn’t learn anything other than to be more careful when they push the narrative in the future.  This is the state of journalism today."

Liberal,"Incoming wall of text:  How can people criticize Sanders supporters while having such a poor understanding of what motivates us?  This article leaves out some of the most revealing material about Mrs. Clinton.  As liberals, we haven't been nearly diligent at calling ourselves out on our failures.  Whenever Trump says something outrageous, the media rightly lays into him.  But Clinton's serious shortcomings haven't received nearly as much coverage.    The Clinton foundation [accepted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/foreign-governments-gave-millions-to-foundation-while-clinton-was-at-state-dept/2015/02/25/31937c1e-bc3f-11e4-8668-4e7ba8439ca6_story.html) millions of dollars from foreign governments while she was still Secretary of State.  Apart from being a massive conflict of interest, [several](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3gmbsp/2015_mother_jones_reports_that_countries_who_gave/) of her top donors went on to receive favorable weapons contracts from the Clinton State Department.  She [also](http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/238313-clinton-changed-stance-on-trade-deal-after-donations-to) changed her stance on a trade deal after the Clinton Foundation received a donation.  Those aren't just charitable donations, that's a quid pro quo.  This is a person who used her office to enrich herself at America's expense by giving favorable terms to nations that were not in our best interest- and that's treason.  I can't vote for someone like that.  It isn't just that I would have liked to see a more progressive platform, which I would, you're asking the Democratic party to endorse and support a candidate that has actively worked against America in the past.  Remember, too that one of her largest donors is the Saudi government.  For those of you who [didn't know](http://intelligence.house.gov/sites/intelligence.house.gov/files/documents/declasspart4.pdf(, the recently released 28 pages proved that the 9/11 hijackers were acting with the financial support and instigation of the Saudi government, not acting independently.  A [grassroots](https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/4uevn2/since_neither_bernie_sanders_nor_the_fbi_decided/) effort to look into the Clinton Foundation found, in addition to the above, money laundering and funds that for the most part did not go to any charity.  The donations aren't even the worst of the scandals surrounding her.  In June 2016, [John Ashe](http://hiddenamericans.com/politics/un-official-found-dead-was-set-to-testify-against-hillary-clinton-same-day-barbell-fell-on-his-neck/), a former official at the UN, died in an apparent weight lifting accident.  He was scheduled to testify against Clinton later that day.  Ashe was going to give testimony about a money laundering scheme from the 1990s that illegally funneled funds to the DNC during Bill Clinton's administration.  As he was going to give testimony that would have implicated the Clintons, the timing of his death is suspect.  It might be possible that someone with ties to the Clintons would die of an accident.  I would expect one or two of those to occur over the course of someone's career.  I would even expect three or four.  But [46](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4l8nl9/has_anyone_ever_looked_into_this_list_of_deaths/) is stretching credibility.  The fact that they were all linked to incriminating information about the Clintons and died of accidents before able to give testimony makes it even less likely that this was a random occurrence.  This is a big enough deal that the mainstream media should be covering it.  But they're not.  I'm not asking that the highly progressive candidate be nominated, compromise is the foundation of democracy.  But I can't vote for someone who sell national interest to the highest bidder, launders money and murders witnesses against her.    The substance of the article itself is similarly lacking.  Their first argument is that the political revolution would be best served by a Clinton presidency even if Sen. Sanders does not win.  It [is true](http://www.counterpunch.org/2016/04/01/how-hillary-clinton-bought-the-loyalty-of-33-state-democratic-parties/) that Clinton was basically bankrolling the state democratic parties, and I will go on the record as saying that electing down-ballot candidates is more important than up-ballot candidates because local issues are more likely to have an impact on your everyday life.  As an aside, that is why so many of the super delegates were dead-set on supporting Clinton- she was bankrolling their re-election campaigns.  But look a little farther, and you will find that funds raised through the Hillary Victory Fund were donated through the state democratic committees to the national DNC fund.  This is legal, but had the effect of impoverishing local campaigns of the funding they needed to run their local campaigns.  Only [one percent](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/04/clinton-fundraising-leaves-little-for-state-parties-222670) of the money raised will go to local candidates.  Starved of election funds, democratic candidates running at the state and local level will be overwhelmed in November by their better-funded Republican counterparts.  The revolution will not be able to continue until the next midterm without widespread grassroots support and bottom-up financing, which is generally considered to be one of Clinton's weakest points and one of Sen. Sanders' strongest.  Whoever wins the presidency, they will find the political landscape overwhelmingly conservative at the local and state level, providing a Republican-controlled congress that will make passing any progressive legislation difficult.  Thus, I say that Clinton is not the best choice for the revolution.  "
Liberal,"The next argument is that the primary was *not* rigged.  At the very least, this claim needs to be investigated further.  A research paper conducted by two graduate students at Stanford [suggested](http://www.snopes.com/stanford-study-proves-election-fraud-through-exit-poll-discrepancies/) that it was likely fraud had occurred.  The counted votes for Hillary Clinton were substantially higher than exit polls reported, but only in states that used electronic voting that did not leave a paper trail.  The firms that make the voting machines have donated to the Clinton campaign.  I similar disconnect to exit polls did not appear in the Republican primary or in the election of 2008.  [Election Justice USA](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/7/29/1554022/-Election-Justice-USA-Study-Finds-that-Without-Election-Fraud-Sanders-Would-Have-Won-by-Landslide) found evidence of fraud at a high enough level that it might have changed the results of the primary.  In other words, Sanders might have won were it not for fraud.  A [second study at Stanford and a paper by a Dutch researcher]( http://www.inquisitr.com/3207171/election-fraud-study-points-to-rigged-democratic-primary-against-bernie-sanders-video/) also found evidence of biased results.  As an aside, I have to criticize the liberals who disregarded these results without considering them.  After linking to peer-reviewed journals and nonpartisan watchdog groups, I was told that this was ""tinfoil hat stuff"", a way to dismiss my argument without considering its merits.  I expect more intellectual honesty from anyone, but especially from someone who claims to be the enlightened party.  No major players in the Democratic party have called for an investigation to the best of my knowledge.  The third argument is that the superdelegates were only supporting the candidate with more pledged delegates, so this was actually a democratic process.  I retort by saying that the existence of superdelegates is inherently undemocratic and makes our party name a sick joke.  [One hundred](http://www.timebomb2000.com/vb/showthread.php?496476-100-of-the-700-quot-superdelegates-quot-were-lobbyists) of teh seven hundred superdelegates were also registered as lobbyists.  A group of wealthy private interests are given direct influence over the presidential candidates that are available in the general election.  A candidate cannot, without great difficulty, become nominated without the support of these lobbyists.  Since general election candidates come from the primaries, this gives them effective control over which people the American public has from which to choose.  Calling that ""democratic"" ventures into Orwellian doublespeak.  There is no evidence to believe that similar election fraud will not occur in the general election, especially since attorney general [Loretta Lynch](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-voting-observers-exclusi-idUSKCN0ZX0QR) has stated that this election will employ one of the fewest number of election observers since the civil rights era.    The fourth argument is that Sanders supporters think that a Trump presidency would cause an even greater progressive change than would a Clinton presidency.  That is generally a false ideal to attribute to us.  It would be ideal to have a progressive president that could assist us in passing progressive policies.  having less political support is less effective by any metric I can imagine.  However, the progressive movement is not the only concern.  The scandals surrounding the email leaks at the DNC showing financial misdealings, allegations of ballot fraud, taking advantage and abandoning down-ballot candidates, and allegations of murder and treason against Mrs. Clinton make the future of the Democratic party itself uncertain.  We've watched with glee as the GOP struggles to confront the possibility of a Trump presidency, but like I said before, we haven't been diligent enough in correcting ourselves.  The loss in confidence from these scandals will lead it in question whether the Democratic party can even continue to exist in its current form.  If elections are not free and impartial, whether the United States can continue to call itself a democracy is likewise in question.  Even a Trump presidency is better than the prospect of losing our democracy forever.  The article gives an argument that those who argue in favor of a Trump presidency do so from a position of privilege that I don't think holds up to scrutiny.  What we are advocating is not that a Trump presidency isn't that bad, only that a Trump presidency, if it cannot be avoided, can be survived.  Allowing election fraud to dictate the outcome of the general election, or even the primary election, would mean the end of democracy in America.  If no third party candidate can be arranged, even a Trump presidency is preferable to that.  The final argument that the article made was that Sen. Sanders was only polling better against Trump was that he hasn't been subjected to the scrutiny that Clinton has over her career in politics.  I disagree.  having written a lengthy post on the misdeeds of Hillary Clinton, I would say that no post of similar length could be written for Sen. Sanders.  He has performed his career in public service entirely without any major scandal, showing a level of integrity that is seldom seen in a politician.  [In fact](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/1/18/1471588/-Nate-Bernie-Sanders-is-the-only-candidate-in-either-party-with-a-net-positive-favorability-rating), according to Nate Silver of the 538 blog, he is the only candidate from either party to have a net positive favorable rating.    While this has, by necessity, been a bit longer than I had wanted, I feel that it is worth my time to write it, if anyone should wish to take the time to read."

Conservative,"Lol Kamala knows he's right and makes it out like he is the bad guy sticking to Republican talking points. He's right. It's too expensive and there is ZERO REASON TO GET RID OF PUBLIC OPTIONS for those of us who want them. When people want to get rid of public healthcare entirely they show that it's not about reasonably covering everyone, it's about moving towards socialism and making us reliant on the government."

Conservative,It's not a conspiracy when it's factual information based upon a situation which actually occurred. Donald Trump is the President Elect and soon to be President of the United States.   This is sickening that this censorship is occurring. 
Conservative,"You realize you're the harassing bigot right now? And there's no difference.   Have you actually been on that sub? All they do is call each other centipedes and use bold letters a lot.

I've seen ten times worse in terms of racism, sexism, basically all forms of discrimination, on /r/politics. "
Conservative,"Like Bill Clinton used to say, that depends on what the meaning of ""debunked"" is. Was CNN's ""Tail Wind"" nerve gas story actually ever really ""debunked?""   It has been reported that a blue t-shirt with a white lettered Trump for President 2016 over a red, white and blue flag motif was unfortunately broadcast without a proper trigger warning for more sensitive viewers during the first showing. This original airing showed the subject speaking via Skype wearing the Trump 2016 shirt. Subsequent showings blurred the Trump t-shirt. Later, a ""Forward with Hillary"" slogan was superimposed over the blurred image and the crawl beneath the image was of a Clinton campaign promotion. In the final airing of the story CNN maintained it was Mrs. Clinton who heroically rescued the child from the burning car."
Liberal,"uh ok, I did go to college actually, but that's not the point. I take it you're currently (while pursuing your PhD) frequently conversing with 18-22 year-olds in casual conversation?

It would be impossible to notice if one were not involved at a personal level with individuals of that age group."

Conservative,"And you didn't bother to read the original comment, because I said ""government approved"". Obviously random people kill each other over land disputes. How many of those people's actions are publicly backed by... all of the people's family, state run media, religious leaders, and a big chunk of the public? How many of those people get a soccer field named after them? How many of those people will have money paid to their family by various organizations, because they approved of their actions? How many of those people will be called ""heroes"", and be celebrated with lavish funerals? I don't understand why you're working so hard to try and compare two completely different things."
Conservative,"It's online play, just in text.  It's not a hard thing to understand. Stop trying to insult people when you know nothing about them.  I am not a neckbeard and yes, it *is* our politics."
Conservative,Whooop! I read so many anti-freedom posts that I didn't catch the sarcasm in yours. 1000 apologies fellow armed citizen.
Liberal,"Identity politics is associating your political allegiance with your racial, cultural, or other form of identity, typically because the party you're aligned stands to benefit that identity even if it may not benefit you as an individual.    I'm a first generation half-Egyptian who was raised Muslim, so I suspect I'm in a somewhat similar position as you, but I think you misunderstand what is meant by the term ""privilege.""    When the white factory worker loses his job he can blame that loss on the ""other.""  Immigrants took his job away from him.  He deserves help to find employment.  The language is very different when discussing minority unemployment: when a POC loses their job it's typically because they're lazy or wanted special treatment.  If they want help to find employment, they just want to live off the government teat, aka ""my tax dollars.""  When a minority does succeed, it's because of a handout or because they're a diversity hire.    Look at the problem of heroin use in white communities vs the problem of drug use in black communities.  In black communities, it's because of the glorification of rap culture, the breakdown of the family, the innate savagery of black people but in white communities, there are all sorts of reasons for rising addiction rates, which are rarely described as a collective moral failure.    Look at what happens when a Muslim kills someone vs when a white person kills someone.  With a Muslim, it's always an act of terror.  You can't really trust those people - that killer is a true representative of Islam as a whole; violent and dangerous.  With a white person, they're always a lone wolf with a mental issue.  They're practically a victim themselves, and strangely they're taken alive by the police far more often than other races.  Maybe the problem is the term ""privilege"" itself and we should find a better word to describe the issue.  Of course the white guy living in Appalachia, or the rust belt, or the rural south doesn't feel privileged, but they still enjoy societal advantages not enjoyed by people of other races."
Conservative,"Why? He's just as crazy as the rest, just more polite and less divisive. His ideas would still destroy the country and are based in Fantasyland."

Conservative,"&gt; NATO serves us no purpose anymore. None of the European countries would do jack shit to defend any other member, especially not USA.  That is an insulting lie.  NATO first invoked Article 5 in 2001, and it wasn’t a European member-state that caused it. After 9/11, we drew our allies into OEF under NATO collective defense.  The UK still has troops in Afghanistan this very moment, for one.  And France wasn’t even bound by Article 5, but still helped."
Conservative,"Where did he say no one appreciates the United States as much as his parents? He said his parents love the United States in the way that only someone who willingly chooses it can.

Conservative,It's not. 
Liberal,"""All men are created equal"" is not meant to literally mean that this is true, but that this is a societal value that we are going to hold ourselves to and uphold.  His failure to understand this is shows how simple minded he is, and he reflect his supporters."

democrats,Nobody should pay taxes. Taxes do not fund spending.  Governments create money out of thin air when they spend.  Google modern monetary theory.
Conservative,"Guess what, everyone sticks to a job they don't like because of the pay, which includes healthcare. Also, in a good economy like we have now, companies need to offer increased benefits, salary and healthcare.   I worked in healthcare, the private insurance companies are subsidizing Medicare.

Liberal,"Ok devil's advocate here. Pence, to me, seems like a somewhat genuine guy. I know he has a history of homophobic legislation and rhetoric but I feel like his motives are right but his information is wrong. If he honestly believes that homosexuality is a disease that makes ones life worse, and he honestly believes it can be changed, then it is good that he wants to treat it. Of course, the basis for these ideas are all wrong, but I feel his actions are driven by a desire to help people rather than a hatred for gays. And the whole religious freedom bill isn't completely in the wrong. It actually doesn't allow for discrimination against gays in the workplace or other places. Its simply that churches / pastors should not have to change their practices by performing an act that they believe is a sin. Again, based on wrong information, but it's understandable."
Conservative,$500M actually in grants so it's actually totally different.
Conservative,Assuming his gender disenfranchises the real lived experiences of trans-cows.
Conservative,"Joe Biden is made head of affairs and liaison for the region in the White House, goes to Ukraine to have several meetings and give a speech encouraging the country to scale up on energy production with the US.  One month later Hunter Biden is appointed to the board of a major energy holdings Corp in Ukraine, Burisma, with a massive salary and zero experience in the sector.  Probably something shady going on there but no definitive crime from the outside looking in (hence, the need for an investigation).  The overt criminality lies in Joe's use of 1 billion dollars in loan guarantees from the taxpayers pocket as a sword in the extortion of Ukraine and firing of the prosecutor who was investigating Burisma for corruption, whose sights would have been set directly on his son.    So, was there a crime in Hunter's appointment?  That's unknown but you can't say there was no crime definitively, and the context of the situation does nothing to make this a sort of pedantic ""well there's always a possibility, you can never know for sure.""  No, the context of his employments implies heavily that there was some level of double dealing and ethical violation happening during Joe's oversight of Ukraine."

democrats,"I believe that an argument framed around mechanisms and ideals, is better than an argument framed by fear, not just for far left but for the whole party. Also, Warren publicly identified as a capitalist (Bernie not so). I think we win on our ideals and morals, if we can effectively explain why we support certain ideas we win. I think the wishy-washy moderate that believes in somethings but not too far is what is killing the Democratic Party. Republicans say what they believe in, why they do what they do, and preach their beliefs everywhere so that people understand their internal reasonings and get behind them. We need to do the same (just with better morals and ideals). The fundamentals of ideals of “the far left” are easy for Americans to get behind: Equality, Opportunity, and Compassion. I don’t agree with Bernie labeling himself as a Socialist for a general election but we have someone like Warren who focuses on plans, labels herself as a Capitalist, and constantly preaches their ideological message I think we have a chance.  I might be wrong but it’s what keeps my belief in humanity haha  edit: for both our sakes lets just hope a democrat wins the office"

Conservative,"&gt; It didn't prevent them from studying gun violence  No, but reducing the CDC's funding by the exact amount that was being spent on gun violence does.  &gt; Much like Oregon Planned Parenthood Opting out of Title X funding rather than accept a ban on referring people to abortion providers. It gives the lie to the idea that they are about womens' health or family planning - they're about abortion.  Alternative: Planned Parenthood opted out of Title X funding rather than accept a ban on referring people to abortion providers because withholding information from patients can be dangerous to their health. Abortion accounts for like 4-5% of planned parenthood's activities, if that leads you to believe that they're only about abortion, then you should really consider taking a remedial math course."

Conservative,"“The Tolerant Left” lol  Jokes aside though, that one about the “conservative only” tags on memes claiming we can’t take criticism on it has some point to it imo. If opposing views want to criticize in the sub in someway, they should be able to. We are pretty open/against censorship, and with the recent r/The_Donald quarantine, I think this is as good of a time as any to think more about what should be marked only for conservatives. That is one thing I do like about this sub, is how it has made more of an effort to create discussion than other political subs (the rest of Reddit lol).   Might not mean much, but some food for thought that I think we, or the mods, should at least think about."
democrats,"Part of me wants to throw out due process since the Trump people do that all the time and just call the guy a kid toucher.  The other part thinks this isn't a big news story because he's Trump, and there's always gonna be a dozen plus suits that he's involved in because he's a prick with too much money.  It's not very newsworthy.  But then again, Wikileaks is a story, and that's basically the equivalent of a National Enquirer story that people somehow assume is totally true.  Maybe the child rape story should get covered more.  Either way, their goal is to make money.  Not to help D, R, or the public."

Conservative,"&gt;What’s wrong with changing how gender is taught?   It's propaganda that makes kids more at risk for mental illness and general unwellness. Kids shouldn't be questioning their genders; it's dangerous and abusive.   &gt;Refusing to do your job because you don’t approve of someone’s sexual orientation is childish, and as a Roman Catholic I believe Jesus taught us to love everyone, as we are all created in God’s image.  It's not a matter of ""doing your job"". It's about freedom of conscience and association to decide what type of events you will or won't take part it. It's no different than an Armenian not wanting to participate in an Ottoman Empire memorial event, or a Jew in a Nazi event.   As far as religion goes, the Catechism of the Catholic Church is clear on homosexuality; while people who have gay feelings are not inherently sinful, the homosexual **actions** are sins. And the modern LGBT movement is characterized by its anti-God and anti-tradition stances. It's perfectly reasonable and I would even say necessary for Christians to not want to take part in blasphemous (and borderline demonic) activities.  &gt;There is no correlation between gender neutral bathroom laws and bathroom safety.   [Then why are women at far higher risk of sexual assault in unisex changing rooms?](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/women/sexual-assault-unisex-changing-rooms-sunday-times-women-risk-a8519086.html)  Noone's demonizing people with mental illness, we're just trying to stop them from endangering others and themselves.  &gt;There are also people who dox and kill LGBT people.   And how often, exactly, does a gay person get doxed and murdered for being gay? I have hardly ever heard of such a thing; I have, on the other hand, seen hundreds of cases just within the last few years alone of conservatives getting doxxed and gone after aggressively simply for their opinions."

I would say that my politics tend towards progressive and liberal in a lot of respects, however I do like to understand and read up on the small government philosophy behind some aspects of conservative politics.  The reason I'm subbed to this sub is so I can hear some reasoned discussion about this side of the political spectrum, and while it's not always the best quality (as you'll find in a *lot* of left leaning subs), it's generally pretty readable, and presents a view in a reasonable way.

Liberals will reflexively bite the hand that feeds them.  are conditioned to demand other people pay for their personal choices, pay for their politically correct college, pay for their birth control, pay for their methadone habit, fund their food choices, pay for their cell phones and buy their designer shoes.

I'm the guy who sells those foreclosed properties for the bank.  So, when the economy turns to shit and the bank forecloses on all the properties, I'm rolling in the dough.  I've got 100 properties in my inventory at any one time, 30 are on the market, and I'm selling 3-10 a week. I'm making beaucoup  bucks.   When the economy recovers, though, people are paying their bills, not defaulting.  Foreclosure rates plummet, foreclosure inventories bottom out.  I've got 15-20 in my inventory, 5-10 on the market at any one time, and I'm selling 2-3 a month.   tl;dr: I'm fucking starving because Obama killed my industry by having the audacity of improving the economy.

Your answer implies that all undocumented immigrants should receive Constitutional Rights. Because they are on American soil."

Sports are pointless public displays of genetic determinism proving nothing but the fact men are stronger than women  and certain men are born to play ball as adults. Without massive taxpayer support for stadiums and subsidized sport training in government schools from childhood to college, the bovine brained athlete would be worth nothing more than a minimum wage worker. As it is, the sports arena is populated with hugely overpaid personalities who confuse piles of money for big brains and feel obliged to tell the world they know something that isn't completely stupid. That these people confuse pushing partisan politics as a path to relevance only shows how these low grade intellects are suited only for watching and breathlessly yelping about costumed gangs of pampered third rate morons chasing a variety of balls for cash and prizes."

I've been out of school for a while now, and I don't have kids, so I can't really say how common core actually is used. It's ostensibly just a set of standards describing what students should be able to do that also has a curriculum associated with it, but it seems that using that curriculum is not doing the job."

Conservative,&gt; Is this the brilliant new way to take on liberals you're talking about? Make up lies about people you disagree with and then belittle the sacrifices of military families?  It's Trump's MO regardless of whether he's taking on liberals (at the moment) or taking on anyone of any ideology that dares to disrespect or accuse him of something. He's thin-skinned and has no self-control when attacked. 
Liberal,That's nice.  I'll still be voting against her.  Things need to change and supporting Hillary and the DNC in the presidential race is not the way to go about it.    I'd rather see Hillary and the DNC lose the presidency but support a Democratic congress that won't support Trump.

Conservative,"It was your idea. Your idea was that schools were going to need more money. But it’s my contention that they don’t. $27 billion dollars gets funneled into public schools. How much more do they need? Does every school need more, or can it go into their budget? Do the schools always operate at a loss? If so, why? What’s missing in all this is the individual basis, the context. Not every school is the same. So, why treat them like Detroit schools, [where $2.7 million goes to a den of thieves.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.freep.com/amp/90090762)"

I liked that, it made the sub more alive, and sometimes stickies would change multiple times an hour, speaking to the sheer volume of content being posted.  Stickied posts get upvoted a ton, but if you look at their hot posts, they have sometimes dozens with just as many upvotes.    The sub is super active, and this is just a way to knock them down because this type of participation drives popular posts to show up in all that the rest of reddit dislikes because of their political views."

You can say in the 50s when the KGB sent agents into the region to create the actual terror groups we know and love today.   You can say in the late 60s early 70s with the PLO and their illegitimate claim to Jerusalem. There is not even ONE mention of jerusalem in the Koran!   Palestine=Philistine. Their home is Jordan.

If you have concerns about what he said, perhaps you should speak to his parents.""  Cops usually have to respond to all calls, but they don't have to take all calls seriously: no claim of a law broken, no police investigation.  It'd be like a cop responding to someone calling and saying ""he called me mean!""  ""...and?""  Just ranting. This stuff pisses me off too"

It's not that their views are different. It's that they change their views so easily whenever it's convenient. As another example of their double think - I pointed out sanders healtcare plan would hurt the poor by imposing payroll taxes for a service they get for free already (through medicaid). His vile supporters said poor people were selfish and needed to start paying their share. They had no problem screwing over the poorest people to protect their shitty narrative"

Conservative,But that's not really what is happening here.   The sought damages were for 40 million.  He settled for 60 percent of them.   That's not really what your situation is talking about when you settle because the cost to defend is higher than the cost of damages.   That's just math.   i'm pretty sure that Trump wasn't going to spend 25 million to defend himself in that case and if so I really want to be on his legal team.

Conservative,Problem? Sure.  Epidemic? Certainly not.
Conservative,"&gt; No, but reducing the CDC's funding by the exact amount that was being spent on gun violence does.  Again, the legislation didn't affect them *studying* gun violence - they just weren't allowed to advocate for gun control.  As to reducing their funding, obviously if they have money to spend advocating for gun control, they don't need more money to be studying disease, and have more than they need.  &gt; Alternative: Planned Parenthood opted out of Title X funding rather than accept a ban on referring people to abortion providers because withholding information from patients can be dangerous to their health  Roughly 1% of abortions are legitimately done for the health of the mother - that's when physicians fill out the forms, rather than patients.  &gt; Abortion accounts for like 4-5% of planned parenthood's activities...  So they claim.  Of course when an abortion requires 20 different line items only one of which is *actually* abortion, that's an easy claim to make."

I've scrolled through there a few times and found it to be no different than the abuse and toxic behavior I experienced in /r/politics for years.  And that's just one comparison.    What offends me most about all of this is /u/spez talking about Trump supporters as though they are any different than the trolls found in any other political sub.  The only real difference is that these particular trolls offend /u/spez 's sensibilities.  He is willing to be blind to anyone treating conservatives that way and has been for years.  There was a brief moment of hope when they removed /r/politics as a default sub, but it didn't change anything.    I would hope that the admin community takes the opportunity to truly self-reflect and find their own biases.  If they start a crack down that winds up being one-sided, they'll share more qualities with historic political tyrants than they would likely be comfortable with... or at least I would hope that wouldn't be comfortable with it."
Republican,"Common core was originally supposed to be just a standardization of national education goals, so that students in different states would be learning the same things in the same grades.  This would keep some states from falling behind, and also make moving from state to state less difficult since we are now a more mobile society.  It was initially not proposed to change *how* things were taught, it was just supposed to outline *when*.   That's not what we got though.  What we got was a billion dollar cash grab by mostly Pearson Publishing - who not only helped create the standards, but also sold the curriculum being put out to publish it.   Practically overnight, thousands of school districts had to change curriculum - which actually translated to no textbooks AT ALL for millions of kids.  My district included.   If they did have curriculum, it was most likely bought from Pearson.  And it was garbage curriculum.  It has performed so badly that school districts all over the country (mine included) eventually dropped the curriculum, or even the CC standards themselves.  The only people it helped were the companies that sold the books.  https://web.archive.org/web/20160126085747/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2015/09/23/common-core-the-gift-that-pearson-counts-on-to-keep-giving/"

Have you ever heard Trump talk about Arab authoritarian governments?   &gt; Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir, who has a warrant out for his arrest issued by the International Criminal Court, joined the chorus of autocratic leaders expressing optimism in the wake of President-elect Donald Trump's victory. &gt;  &gt; In an interview with Emirati daily al-Khaleej, Bashir suggested dealing with a Trump administration would be more “straightforward” and “much easier” than his predecessors. He noted with satisfaction that Trump may be less likely to lecture about human rights and civil liberties. &gt;  &gt; Trump “focuses on the interests of the American citizen, as opposed to those who talk about democracy, human rights and transparency,” Bashir said, according to the Associated Press's transcription of the interview. &gt;  &gt; “I am convinced that it will be much easier to deal with Trump than with others because he is a straightforward person and a businessman who considers the interests of those who deal with him.” he said. &gt;  &gt; Bashir has ruled Sudan since 1989. His government suppresses dissent and is embroiled in a 13-year conflict in the impoverished Darfur region. The United Nations estimates the violence has led to some 300,000 deaths and displaced more than 2.5 million people. In 2009, the International Criminal Court in The Hague issued a warrant for Bashir's arrest over alleged crimes against humanity and war crimes, and added a genocide charge in 2010. The move compels Bashir to only travel to nations that promise ahead of his arrival not to act on the warrant when he lands. &gt;  &gt; "

The real question is if this administration really respects the rule of law as much as Josh Earnest espoused it did during his press conference.

All he would have had to do was reign in his crazy, ridiculous ramblings, put out a presidential image, and talk a little policy now and then. It would have been *so easy* for him to destroy Clinton.   The fact that he was unable to do this illustrates his utter unfitness for office. He has so little self control that he's going to lose the election because of stunts like this (which, need I remind everyone, happen *every single week*). The fact that he can't control himself enough to win means one of two things:  1. He is purposely throwing the election (not out of the realm of possibility).  2. He actually can't control his impulses and craves the spotlight too much to do so.   Either way, he shouldn't be President.  Clinton is such a weak candidate, too. It's astonishing how badly he's doing against her. If we had wanted to win this cycle, we should have nominated Kasich-Rubio as a ticket and watched a 300+ electoral vote landslide roll our way.

Conservative,"Being ""slightly intellectually superior"" is better than being Moslem. Immigration is a policy whereby a nation state permits a limited number of chosen people into its borders. Citizens of the host country get to decide whether this or that immigrant is to be a welcomed guest. Moslems have proved difficult in this regard as Islam presents a peculiarly stultified system.   As long as migrant male Moslems continue to represent a real and present retrograde force fundamentally opposed to modernity, clean water and proper norms of behavior, more advanced people in slightly superior cultures will have no use for masses of them. Even a medieval peasant knows it is always better being a serf in Europe than suffering as a slave of one of the Sultans of Zanzibar."
democrats,"Moscow Mitch is much better at doling out pork than Paul Ryan ever was, and he also doesn’t have a portion of his caucus that is full of kooks so it sells to Corporate America better than the House.

If you're going to race-bait and play identity politics it is only a matter of time until white people start doing it too.

Unfortunately many of the folks peddling it are the same motherfuckers who forced Hillary Clinton down our throats. The problem with the party isn't fucking ""identity politics"" the problem with the party is that social issues are the only thing we stand for anymore. That isn't the fault of the coloreds, the Jews or the gays, it is the fault of the party's middle, the ""third way"" and all those who decides moderation was the path to victory.  It's hard to have this conversation with folks, because the opinions of folks like bill mahr are really easy for young to middle aged white dudes to have. Some people don't get a choice, some folks don't see their identities as only politics but also something worth fighting for. Of all the fucking lessons to be learned from this election, this is about the worst one possible. I never wanted Clinton, I didn't vote for her (who cares I live in DC) but fuck those who are convinced that we lost the election because of ""identity politics""."

Conservative,"What was stopping other countries from suing us in their courts before? How could other nations collect on their lawsuits? I doubt they would repo American assets lmfao you think other countries would go through that nightmare just for some random citizens?

Conservative,"I agree with you.my hope is he really sees the position as a management job, he will put competent people in charge of specific areas where he doesnt have the experience or knowledge, and pretty much support them. He'll leave decisions to the experts and essentially Manage. I think he'll focus his efforts on getting a wall built and marketing his administrations policies to the public for their support. He will in many instances be a figurehead. That is the only explanation that makes sense to me, why he clearly has no interest in details and debate prep. Unless something dramatic occurs though, in my opinion he lost the election with that debate performance. It was the worst performance maybe in the history of televised debates. I probably will vote Trump but it'll hurt to do it."

Still, the man made a promise and he kept it.  I gotta give him credit for that."

It'd be nice to see a forum spawn out of Reddit (like a pure website) that had a conservative bias. That way there would be a way to reinvigorate the internet with a presence that wasn't ""anti-family"", ""anti-stability"", etc. "

Conservative,Based on gender!!1!
Conservative,“Based on gender”   They assumed gender!
Conservative,"Then you are using the term ""inherently"" wrong. Inherent means, ""belonging to the basic nature of someone or something."" So if something is a learned behavior, it is not inherent. And the values and morals of a group or culture are learned behaviors that are taught. By definition, they cannot be inherent. Inherent means that a black raised by whites, surrounded by whites and as a white will still act like all the other blacks because of some innate characteristics of blacks.  By saying ""blacks inherently commit more crime,"" you are saying that there is something biological or genetic about blacks that predispose them towards committing more crime. It's saying that apart from culture, blacks everywhere tend to commit more crime than non-blacks.   And saying, ""There is inherent blackness in black culture"" is circular reasoning that means nothing. "

Obama set America back and only managed to harm the black community.  Obama didn't do anything worth praising during his presidency.

Conservative,"I have been banned from many LGBT related subs from discussing radical Islam as a threat to our community.

For years it seemed like the Left had a monopoly of political humour and it's just entertaining seeing them be challenged.   Of course the big problem is they idolize the man which makes honest criticism of him downright impossible on the sub. Unfortunately that happens when we elect a celebrity, not that Obama was any better...."

Sure, if you dig enough CNN has a small article saying on it, claiming it was a coincidental meeting, nothing bad happened, and the vast right wing conspiracy is at it again. Typical CNN.

If only we could change the stigma and the way we view child pedophiles and maybe the world would be a better place.  My new favourite hobby is pointing out thought processes like that to my Left leaning friends and saying ""That is why people voted for Trump by the way"". Most recently there was a discussion between a few people about foreign home ownership (more specifically Chinese investors buying up real estate to get their money out of China) and someone kept on talking about how racist the whole conversation was and how it's basically like anti-Semitic Nazi propaganda before WWII and I said ""Your refusal to talk openly about this topic and just throwing about the racism card is why Trump is President"".

Conservative,If the idea is that black lives matter *too* then why don't people say that? The answer is that the movement is fully racist i.e. black supremacist. They take what may be a legitimate grievance and go way too far in the attempt to right the perceived wrong. There isn't a single thing wrong with challenging this racist rhetoric with a balanced alternative. The fact that saying something so harmless can bring upon someone a punishment like this is outrageous. It is a double standard where offensive language is protected and the reasonable alternative is punished. It's morally backwards.

Conservative,My point is that the lying liberal media uses polls as just another tool in their arsenal to attack the republican.

This peculiar Prophet -- who must not be slandered -- also waxed poetically about the delights and medicinal qualities the sunbaked Bedouin brain can derive from swilling hot camel urine close to the source.   Clearly, by voting with his dirty feet, angry Ahmed Mohamed publicly prefers cold Coke to hot salty camel water, is more partial to the welcoming arms of the Great Satan than the boy rape common in the Moslemlands of misery.  After Moslems murdered and maimed infidel children and cops and Chinese at the Boston Marathon Massacre, little Ahmed had a good laugh and gained international Islamic acclaim by terrorizing kids at a Texas school with the vibrant diversity of a fake bomb that really ticked.   Even President Obama, who believes in his own private discredited, bastardized apologist version of violent imported Islam, laughed like his two teethy Moslem fathers before him and was inspired to invited the budding suicide vest soldier of Islam to the White House to celebrate his hajj on the taxpayer's dime. Soon, young Ahmed was flying modern jet aircraft off to the backwards, filthy, intolerant, stupid, hate-filled, bigoted, squalid, tyrannical homeland of the real Mohomet. There, he was destined to do his mandatory religious duty as a good Mohommadan migrating to Mekka.   Recently, also in the Islamic news, we learned Mullah Omar Mateen, too, made his Mekka pilgrimage before he refugeed his religion upon the sex sinners leaving dozens dead during Hispanic night an Orlando gay bar. Like Mateen, little Ahmed Mohamed's has fulfilled his once in lifetime trip, learned all about hot hate in the harsh sunlight. Now, the pilgrim has no other to make other than the last one way trip to Paradise. One wonders whether thus inspired, if his future clock construction will be so third rate and fake. "

I know more older people (50-60 range) than I do younger people that have blocked people, told people to stop posting on their Facebook page, and generally been hostile. That makes sense though because they've had more time to develop strong partisanship. In my opinion, the safe space/trigger warning issue is just a repeat of the same ""kids these days"" argument made by every generation ever. "

I'm not going to pretend he doesn't exist -- we can't, obviously.  If you mean normalize said views and pretend they won't lead the country (and much of the rest of the world) to ruin, then no, I will not.  As an American, or indeed, as a citizen of any democracy, he has the right to hold whatever views he pleases. But those views are not immune from criticism. They aren't immune from facts and logic, both of which dictate that almost all of his views are objectively wrong or detrimental.   So yeah. If being opposed to things that are simply wrong is bigotry, then I guess I'm a bigot."

Conservative,"To be clear, I'm not a fan of Warren's plan. I want Bernie's.  His plan is paid for by raising taxes, as one would expect. At the same time, we no longer pay premiums, copays, deductibles. An overall savings for most people that also expands coverage. Given that disaster can strike anyone at any time and that we often don't have control over it, I think his plan makes the most sense.  And I don't see much use for private insurance companies. To me, they look like leechy middlemen.  And I'm a fan of Bernie because he's one of the few people I've seen involved in government that legit seems to give a shit about everyone. And I like many of his policy positions, as well as his principles. I'd like to see more like him in government.  Warren is in my top 4, but I'd still consider her nomination to be a loss.  And if none of my top 4 get the nomination, I'd just as soon vote trump. The man is a lightning rod for attention and has engaged the public in the political process like none other."

Conservative,"She is up in Arizona because one poll from Arizona Republic where she lead bigly. Look at their data. Their sample had 57% Democrats, Republicans 23.6%; Other 19.4%. Most of them were young voters. You can weight data from it. They actually admit it and did it. But problem is that with this weird sample - there will be big moe. And there is one more problem... Education. Their sample was:   Bachelors or more 409   Some Collage 201   High School or less 103  And they dont weighted this. Im not US citizen so I dont know how many people in Arizona are at least bachelors+ but I doubt that it is 60% population (even in group with only registered voters).  If Im wrong here, feel free correct me."
Conservative,I thought CNN said this was impossible because she didn't have the questions ahead of time? Doesn't this really implicate CNN in this debacle also?
Conservative,"&gt; If you have a ""but"", you aren't taking responsibility.  That's a very large over generalization. ""It's my fault but we need to come together and do what we can"" seems like taking the blame to me.  Also not saying Obama is a saint, but lets not act like he is the first president to try to dodge every bad thing thrown at him. "
Conservative,"I think I hate Chris more than I hate trump. Every time I get close to making a decision to vote for trump, he does this shit that immediately makes me not want to vote for him. Shapiro is right, there is never good trump without really bad trump. "
Conservative,Yeah you're kinda right. It's not going to shit because it already is shit.
Conservative,"If they started coming to my country and immediately staging protests, trying to change the fabric of our nation instead of assimilating, I would have USCIS halt or severely limit TPS and Refugee Petitions. When you come to a country, especially with the intent of staying, you assimilate to their culture. You are a visitor trying to become a citizen. These people have made it clear they have no intention of doing so, and greedily take our hospitality for granted. If you let a homeless man into your house and all he did was bitch that you never had steak, would you want to keep him around?"

Conservative,"Stabby is right, they bury these stories instead of putting them on the front page. It's like putting the death of Prince on the obituary page in small print with a black and white photo. This is an election year for christ sake, if Ted Cruz (who lost the nomination) was meeting with an important figure who could influence an investigation against him he would get more media coverage than Hillary. I just searched Clinton on google news. Most of them are pro Hillary or anti Trump. The rest are about a delay in the investigation. Why should anyone have to search for Loretta Lynch to get this story? "

Generally speaking industrial owners provide their own security as relying on civilian police for protection is a demonstrated joke.  Police policy would be to not use force to prevent property crime by the mobs but to let property be destroyed and is part of industrial site risk assessment pricing.  Warren knows all this but chooses the word maurders to invoke savages in the streets. Lead by her native America self in war paint.  Bad imaging I think: we all know how the Indian wars played out."

Obama had the drive to go to law school graduate magna cum laude, become a politician, become a senator, run for the president, run for president again, and someone is gonna unironically suggest he is most interested in destroying this country? that person has obviously already made up their mind. And/or defines ""anti-american"" on a level I deeply disagree with. Thus it's not really worth engaging."

Conservative,"We want to believe Americans deserve a better class of ruling elite than the crooked Clinton cabal. But we don't. This sad reality is evidenced everywhere by the fact these corrupt creatures continue to constantly creep across our viewscreens and newfeeds like horribly bloated undead vampires of the apocalypse. Americans love them so much they either repeatedly vote these reviled reprobates into office or else pliantly enjoy the entertainment of watching them unabashedly manipulate election results to their benefit.   They promise to despise US. They promise to treat our rule of law with unmitigated contempt. They promise to lord over us like we were dirt eating, dirt preferring, dirt loving slaves. They promise to ruin the country and wreak the world. And for all their unearned arrogance, ham handed incompetence and unabashed avarice, we push them to the top of every popularity poll, gift them Grammy's and put their faces everywhere on propaganda posters and pop magazines alike.  Look around at all the indolent bed pressers and structural Marxists and safety safe space demanding adult diaper wearing Millennials and overfed Sandernistas and the generations of welfare queen spawn. Americans deserved better, but we got lazy, got on the dole, ate another huge EBT chocolate cake, got drunk on Victory Gin, watched Big Brother on TV and fell asleep."

Conservative,I'd pay that guy to shut the fuck up. 
Republican,"I think this article does raise some interesting points.  I don't like Trump's coziness with Putiin.  At the same time...the whole ""Trump's a Putin puppet"" thing smacks of Clinton dirty-trick messaging.  What I don't think the article understands is NATO's mission.  It's the same as and as important as it ever was.  It is an alliance.  Trump could just Google really, if he doesn't understand the importance of our allies.  http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_17120.htm  An attack on one is an attack on all.  This was invoked after the Sept 11 attacks.  NATO troops went into Afghanistan.  &gt;So people have now asked why isn't it fighting international terrorism?   I believe there have been NATO sorties that have done this... but fighting terrorism needs to be within the parameters of the treaty.   "
Conservative,"Not surprising, since he's recently put out his extremely partisan book for the election, *We're Still Right, They're Still Wrong*. He wants to sell books and he wants to believe liberals are always right. Anything that contradicts that point will short circuit him."

Conservative,So they can't be helped?
Conservative,"Sure, but on the gripping hand, it's also fucking over if Clinton pursues her stated goals effectively. "
Republican," &gt;Trump is just as horrible if not more so than Clinton.  How so?   &gt;If you're supporting him, you've already, at least tacitly, approved of him.  True, to a point. We can't lump all of the Trump supporters together, there are three groups:  -The ones that are fully on the Trump train that lie and twist words in order to defend him.  -The ones that like some of his policies but remain critical.  - Finally, the ones that will vote for him purely to stop Hillary.   &gt;That approval diminishes your capacity to call him out on anything.  I disagree. I'm voting for him to stop Hillary fully acknowledging who and what he is. If Trump wins, he could do a decent job, in which case I can remain confident in my vote. If he does a poor job, I can be even more critical because he betrayed my vote and my confidence in him.   &gt;At some point, people have to realize that you can take a stand and not have to do mental gymnastics to justify your horrible candidate choices. Until more people do, we'll only have terrible binary choices like Trump and Clinton.  This I agree with, but this only applies to the first group of Trump supporters.  "
Conservative,"&gt; As to reducing their funding, obviously if they have money to spend advocating for gun control, they don't need more   This is money that was spent on research. Research != advocacy. When your budget is cut by the literal exact amount that you spent on research, it doesn't really matter whether it was literally banned or not.  &gt; Roughly 1% of abortions are legitimately done for the health of the mother  There are other reasons why abortion can be dangerous to someone's health. If someone is absolutely adamant about getting an abortion and there's no clinical settings to do so, that's when people get [creative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsafe_abortion#Health_risks). Apparently Planned Parenthood would rather offer/recommend safe, clinical abortions than have their patients find some dude on Craigslist or a coat hanger."
Conservative,"The Democrat Party dragged the lurking Russians in to the election like they always do. For all the high hopes and airy, fairy promises of perfect living liberals market, the faith is represented by the lowest sort of indolent Tobacco Road trash. Obama has implied there is Russian duplicity. John D. Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, said that Russian intelligence officials are intent on swaying the disaffected masses to climb into Dee Jay Trump's basket of irredeemable deplorables.  “I’ve been involved in politics for nearly five decades,” Hillary puppet Podesta told Hillary's reporters aboard the Clinton carnival cash campaign plane. “This definitely is the first campaign that I’ve been involved with in which I’ve had to tangle with Russian intelligence agencies,” the puppy said, “who seem to be doing everything that they can on behalf of our opponent.”  Who do we believe?

I think he'll do immeasurable amounts of damage to conservatism and the GOP in the public's eye. His foreign policy ""positions"" are downright terrifying. His positions on trade could cause a recession. He says bigoted things because he can't distinguish actual bigotry from being politically incorrect. He's a complete moron.  The only thing that makes me even consider voting for him is the SC, but I don't even trust him to appoint conservative Justices. Reagan appointed only one true con to the court, how am I supposed trump to do that right?"
democrats,Millions?  Lol. 
Conservative,I'm shocked she hasn't asked CNN for a manager yet.
Republican,"You do not need to buy into conservatism 100% to be a Republican. This is one of the problems the never Trumpers did not seem to understand. Same goes for religious beliefs, I personally find myself more socially liberal. I just have more/stronger beliefs which fall in line with the Republican party, so I tend to vote republican. It is the Republican party not conservative party. "

Conservative,"The modern ""Christian"" notion of peaceful coexistence must be forced upon the social spoilers of the ""religion of peace."" The Western science of war, when applied liberally, can eventually convince even the worst among the world community it is best they conform to calm Christian compassion. It's the current year and the camel is not a car.  Good religious people are free to believe as they please as long as they don't believe nonbelievers must conform to their beliefs. Modern jihadis can walk around worried about dog walkers as they please, but their holy anti canine crusade should remain an inner struggle never becoming some nonMoslem's issue."

Conservative,"&gt; and not paying taxes.   By trying to push that absurd line, you immediately lose credibility.  If the insinuation is that Trump illegally evaded taxes, then the response should be prosecution - given the globally-advertised nature of the situation and the control over prosecution being in his political opponents' hands, we can assume that they would have, if there were evidence of evasion.  If you have such evidence, please post it.  Otherwise, you're referring to following rules on losses and deductions, which apply to every individual and corporation.  Claiming that deducting expenses or taking losses is ""not paying taxes"" is disingenous and childish, and reflects a complete lack of understanding of accounting and tax rules."
Conservative,"Because, as Justice Thomas put it, the rights NOT actually enumerated in the Constitution are preferred over those that are there explicitly."

democrats,"Of course that is total bullshit given the Trump campaign has and still virtually owns Facebook, them and Russians, along with Fox, NewsMax and the fact that the majority of newspapers are still owned or ran by conservatives and when it comes to radio or television local news, well Sinclair Media is the dominant force there which loves their Trump."
Conservative,I think this will be the turning point for his campaign and he'll never look back.

Liberal,"yeah, he's far from perfect. I've seen two of his shows. I disagreed with him about getting on the Hillary train, should have fought back against the DNC over corruption. maybe could have had Pres-elect Sanders."

democrats,I guess all the Sanders supporters don't share the same respect for Hillary that Sanders says he has.

Conservative,Because he passes the Buckley test.  He's the most conservative candidate that can win.

Conservative,"Well said, thank you"
Conservative,"If he is using the power of his office to persuade, that would seem to be within the role of a President (or what a President should do) - to fight on behalf of his constituents.  However, if there were threats of punishment, or special access/contracts/grants not available to other businesses were promised in exchange, then it would indeed be worrying."
democrats,"Article 2, Section 1, Clause 2 says State Legislatures choose who the electors for their state are and those electors vote for the President.  There is no Constitutional requirement to even HAVE an election.     The 7 Rulings by the Supreme Court regarding Ballot Access have boiled down to: IF States are going to have an election then they can enact any laws they want to limit ballot access as long as  1. It's not too expensive for the poor to  get on the ballot (poor being a relative term, it still costs over $600,000 to get on the ballot in Texas) 2. It's not restricted based on religious affiliation, gender, race, or in the case of Federal positions cannot be more restrictive for age than the Constitution (ie: states can't require Presidential Candidates to be over the age of 75 and/or under the age of 70 - which would disqualify Trump)."
Conservative,This is more like a town hall for Biden and Harris.
Conservative,"Nope. I have no desire to kill anyone, nor do I want to go to jail to prove a political point.   Now, as for your hypothetical, do you really think your gun is going to stop somebody in a semi?"
Conservative,"In no way does he say definitively ""watch a sex tape"". He says ""check out"", which could very easily mean check out that she has a sex tape, not actually go and watch it. If she's trashing him he has every right to tell people to check out her past. I swear, this sub is becoming worse than r/politics."
Liberal,well not all are exactly alike obviously.
Conservative,"That's hogwash.  Conservatism will *not* be permanently destroyed by a Trump presidency.  The question each one of us needs to ask: which name would you rather see as the winner come Nov. 8? Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump?  It's only going to be between these two. Which candidate would you rather see as president?  ""I'd rather not see any of them. I hope they both lose.""  That's fine. I'm not persuading anyone to vote for Trump (I'm not even going to vote for him). But one of those two *will* win. Whose name would you be more relieved to read as the winner on/after Election Day?"
Conservative,Well said

Conservative,"Thanks for the video. I just went on a Gowdy kick on YouTube. I think the thrill here is that he pins these worms with questions. We know they are obstructing justice and biased, and he reveals that in no uncertain terms."
Conservative,"Too many people are somehow pretending that they'll ever get anti-discrimination laws removed. I guarantee that will never happen. There is no chance. So whatever 00Chubby would *like* reality to be, the arguments need to be framed within the actual reality.  Anti-discrimination laws are very, *very*, narrow. You can't generalize them and discuss other discrimination that's completely legal like no-shirt-rules. Businesses are required to not discriminate based on that list of 8-10 things, but the obvious loophole is that if you don't specifically tell someone that's why you're refusing service it becomes incredibly hard to prove. This applies to 'messages' on cakes as well, because a cake maker can refuse *the message itself* without technically stepping on anti-discrimination laws.  If christian bakers want to refuse to make cakes for gay weddings it's easy. Just don't literally, specifically, tell them that they're refused because they're gay. Tell them you're busy. You looked on the schedule and can't do it. You feel too inexperienced with the style they want. You've got a vacation planned. Whatever. Something. Anything. Just don't say 'gay' and it's almost impossible to prove in court.  "
democrats,"you again?  please.    Talk about false equivalency.   We don't all vote as 1 country.  We vote in States, have districts.    They never have every state, every district do a recount.   Only the areas that are being challenged.      Now go away, you are boring."
Conservative,Political Special Olympics is a great way to think about this election
Conservative,Your reply is interesting but if you do a little bit of research Trump didn’t dodge the draft. His birthday (lottery number) was never called during the draft. So how did he “dodge” the draft? Bill Clinton’s number WAS called and he never served. It’s safe to say that Bill Clinton does qualify as a draft dodger but the left will never acknowledge that fact.  https://www.historynet.com/whats-your-number.htm

Conservative,"So, basically this comes down to Ted Cruz and Mark Meadows wanting to completely eliminate all campaign finance restrictions.  Let anyone contribute any amount of money to any candidate directly as long as there is disclosure.    I'm not against this idea in principle, but I have to question Cruz's characterization of it as ""leveling the playing field.""  I don't think it does that at all.  I don't necessarily oppose it, but I certainly don't think it's going to put my few thousand dollars on the same level of influence as George Soros's billions."

Conservative,"Free market doesn't mean that the company censors news/things it doesn't like. A free market would allow the people themselves to reject the news outlets they don't like on the platform. A free market mindset would see Facebook, Google, etc as a market place, a bazaar of sorts, that we can ""shop"" at by clicking links and seeing the product on the other side. No one forces you to click on a bad news link just as no one forced you to buy Coby brand products even though they look close enough to Sony, thus being somewhat deceptive. If you're not going to contribute your own efforts and diligence to read the ""about"" page on the news website or determine the quality of the brands you're looking at, you get what you deserve. I would say the only interference that is respected/appreciated/approved is removing harmful, dangerous material (toxic/poisonous, wildly obscene, endangering minors, or other extreme things) but those are few and far between and the rest is fair game.

The few that show up will be a mish-mash of write-ins, 3rd parties, and the gruesome twosome.

The father yelled out, ""Excuse me sir, but where are we?""  The man yelled back, ""You're in the middle of the ocean!"" and then drove off.   The father turned to his son and said, ""That man was an attorney.""  The son asked, ""how do you know, dad?""  The dad replied, ""because he told us the exact answer to our question and it was of absolutely no value."""
Conservative,"And as I said in the rest of my comment, the exact study you linked made note that it should, as I quote, ""inspire improved psychiatric and somatic care after sex reassignment for this patient group."" Which means further treatment for your mental and physical health is important, since it's not a cure-all, fix-all. Just one of many things that can be done to help improve the mental and physical health of many trans people.   The general focus on that study is to gather information on the cases of death for people who have transitioned. It also brings up various other studies, and the ratio of people who had died after transitioning in the studies mentioned have such a small ratio of dead to still living people. So if you're trusting their results, while they still advocate more research into the subjects of treatment for trans people, there's nothing that I can see that advocates for stopping the treatments either. It even mentions that transitioning is the best known method of treatment for trans people's dypshoria."

Conservative,"I inferred the comment about “the ability to collect people’s ballots” having an influence on results to imply some sort of alteration in transition.  If we’re just talking about a ground game, then yes, the party’s infrastructure is doing well. But I still worry more about top-down policy/rhetorical messaging than the organizational side."
Conservative,The president is a bigot.....I’m an objective reporter too!!!!
Conservative,"No, its not. See Austin Petersen for a prime example."
Conservative,"Let’s unpack this. Claiming some form of mental illness/disease/instability as a cause for murder is understandable. Moreover, most mass murderers likely have some form of psychosis.  If we had a better mental health system these murders may never have happened, because these people would either have been helped or already institutionalized. However, we should not accept it as a valid excuse when it comes to assigning responsibility and delivering justice.   This POS May have been high and a virulent anti-Semite, but justice must be done, lest every bigot smokes some weed and commits murder.   “I was high, two men kissed right in front of my face. I just had to kill them. I saw the devil possessing them!”   Plug in any group that you wish, this kind of thinking opens the door wide open to murder without retribution or justice, and the judge accepting and even allowing this type of defense is promoting evil."

Conservative,She was SHOCKED to see her garden cause vegetables to grow out of dirt
Conservative,"It is a good strategy. Look at how derailed Trump got over the stubby fingers comments. It is really easy to push his buttons and put him on the defensive, where he flounders. Can you imagine the debate prep? Maybe one dig a day, with 24 hours to recover between?  The other thing Hillary knows is that the biased MSM press will spin any comment from Trump into the most damning possible light.  I think his best counter is something like ""I know you want to divert from the issues, and for issue _____ my plan is to do _____. What is your plan? Or do you want to just waste all of our time on personal insults?""  The problem is that strategy is almost off of the table for Trump considering it was him doing the personal slights during the primaries nonstop."

If ICANN is an international governing body, one that does not guarantee first amendment rights, not only can the website censor posted material, but the entire governing body can too; that is something that doesn't happen currently because freedom of speech is protected by the first amendment.

Conservative,You mean like Trump wants?

Conservative,"Well sure, she's got a much longer record, gotten a lot more shady stuff done, but then with her husband, they've essentially achieved synergy of criming.

Conservative,You likely need scuba gear to see what's left of him. 
Conservative,"That's a more reasonable approach, but bias exists everywhere too. In your example of the murder I would say that it depends. What race was the victim and are we in Atlanta or green bay? It does matter, but these nuances don't always show up in statistics.If a police officer is approaching me and I'm carrying a gun as a criminal, is it safe to be black or white?"
Conservative,I will just say this.....there once was a group of natives...lets call them Native Americans...the had no border patrol and an outside group migrated to their land in mass. They then forced their culture on the Native Americans.  How are the Native Americans doing in current times?

Meanwhile, Trump supporters are allowed nothing but their support of one very uneven, emotional man. The people supporting the Republican candidate are judged by terrible Trump's individual faults and are not allowed to have shared goals or their vision of America.   If you discredit Trump, it is believed you also discredit this half of America who are bitterly clinging together in their irredeemable basket of deplorables. Discredit Hillary, however, and you are a heartless bigot attacking women and minorities and their hordes of helpless, hungry, needful children. The never Trump people should consider voting for bigger things than Trump. The other side certainly is."

This is the price for taking comfort in polls that were in our favour and doing nothing about it.  Now its time to pick up the pieces, eh?"

Not sure why you think the Donald's brand new stances on government size, taxes, borders, etc would hold. His only advocacy is to get attention and try to make people think he's a badass with power. This is the guy who starred in a reality TV show and commercials when he had enough money to never work again. You really think he feels like he owes anyone anything?"

Conservative,"Saturday is Laylat Al Qadr, or Night of Power. Worshipping Allah on that day is worth worshiping him for 1000 months.        Most Muslims translate Qadr as divine or holy, while the extremists go for the more jihadish meaning of qadr.  "

Conservative,"With ""differently"" she meant the way it happened, not the deed that she decided to take in the refugees itself.  And yes, crime is bound to happen when you let in so many people. But there is nothing to suggest that ""real"" refugees, coming out of countries such as Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan are major groups of violent crime perps.  The problem is that with no border control, we do not know exactly where all refugees are coming from. The most difficulties arise with Maghreb Arabs (Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria), which have no right to stay in Germany and if not in possession of a residency permit, will be deported.   My opinion is that migration/asylum seeking is a hugely controversial topic where *differentiation* and *precise fact-stating* are immensely important. This absolutely biased article is a showcase of catastrophe seeking journalism to be used as political leverage in its own country (UK in this case). Try reading actual German media for a view with more nuance."

Conservative,"&gt; Oh. And no evidence for any claim linking biden to protecting his son has been found.  ...other than Biden's bragging on national TV about having threatened the Ukrainian government into firing the prosecutor on pain of loss of US aid money, and the prosecutor's sworn statement saying that at the time he was fired, he was investigating not just the company that Hunter Biden was working for (at $50k/month to handle ""transparency and corporate governance"" - despite having no experience in the energy sector, Ukrainian law, or professional legal counsel), but Hunter Biden in person."

Many times we dawn posts about how we we were unfairly calling trump supporters racists or sexist or whatever and then the top level comments would be racist or homophobic. It is frustrating when this is taking of r/al since sometimes you want to relax and then argue about politics.  That being said- this election showed many on the left that they weren't effectively communicating with the right. That we weren't listening and making some assumptions. For example it has become convoluted when liberals try and call out structural racism /sexism- it feels like we have been calling individuals racist (which is a really offensive thing to be called if you are trying to make your opinions of people regardless of race).

I was holding onto a shred of hope that id be able to vote for Trump come November 8th, so I paid attention to everything he's said, listened to his speeches, and watched the debate. Trump is a mess, and I'm no longer considering voting for him because principle is more important to me than party unity.   &gt;you mean he is speaking to the voters he most identifies with?  You've been inhaling too much of your God King's orange cheeto dust if you honestly believe Trump identifies with low information blue collar workers, let alone care about them just one bit.   &gt;You're upset because he panders to people you can't relate with   lmao, oh my god this is rich. The candidate you JUST said didn't pander, you're now arguing panders to certain voters. Huh, this sounds a lot like Trump. Says one thing one minute, then changes his mind the next. Sometimes in the same interview!   Listen, kid. I know you're enthusiastic to be voting for a real life Troll doll, maybe your first vote in an election; but don't try to pretend Trump is any more than he actually is: a liberal Democrat from New York with New York values who assumes positions that are politically popular just as quickly as he discards them.

Other boxes without the words have clear remnants of sloppy use of the healing brush and clone stamp tools to remove the words from those boxes.   The image is also clearly reversed. The box that the subject is holding still has a bit of the words ""BALLOT BOX"" on it - backwards.

Conservative,"His options are limited. He needs someone who is articulate and a good debater, and someone who can agree with him on the issues and can make the case for them to the media. That eliminates just about all of the 16 primary contenders except Christie and maybe Cruz. He also needs someone who won't wilt and turn on him at the first sign of adversity. That eliminates most of the other possibilities, like Corker.   Christie's combative style will be helpful. The media will come after any VP nominee and he will have to be able to stand his ground on the issues and on Trump. Christie will do that. Who else would be good at that? Probably Sessions, Newt and Cruz.   Those are the only possibilities imo -- Christie, Sessions, Newt and maybe Cruz. It's too bad there's so much bad blood between Trump and Cruz. Cruz is a tested candidate with support among the conservative base and has other good assets. Trump needs someone who can win over the base. Right now he's polling in the 70's among Republicans. He needs to secure the base, and Cruz could help him do that. Order of preference -- Cruz, Christie, Sessions. Newt has too much baggage."

Conservative,"The government shouldn't be micro managing by handing out money or playing favorites.  If tax breaks works, cut taxes.    The only reason the US has remained competitive with the companies still here is because we practice free trade.  It's also better for the US consumer too.  Without free trade jobs won't remain anyway--some will even though consumers pay more for their inefficiently made goods, others will fold.  The 1930 tariffs act was a disaster.  The US market is limited, believe it or not, and without free trade (called reciprocity) our economy doesn't grow.  Over 20% of our GDP is from foreign trade and has accounted for a lot of the country's growth over the last several decades.    Also, jobs moving overseas accounts for very little lost manufacturing jobs.  Most of it is lost to automation (increased efficiency).  Most counties, including China and India, have seen periods where manufacturing jobs have dropped off.  "

If the election was purely based on popular vote then the GOP would have a different strategy.  &gt; We only win because of gerrymandering the districts to keep power on our side  Well first of all, the states aren't gerrymandered.  And the fact that Republicans control the governorship in 33 states - a popular election - should be evidence that electoral victory is not all about gerrymandering.  &gt; I feel like it's more that we don't really give a damn about helping non-Americans.  I care about non-Americans.  I just care for them less than I do for Americans.  I care for people outside my family less than my family too.  It's simply tribalism as a way of accepting reality.  If we cared as much for non-Americans as we care for Americans, we would have to give up a lot to raise the standard of living of billions of impoverished people.  I am not willing to accept poverty so everyone can be equally poor."

Conservative,"How aboit NO. That is NOT going to happen, nor should it. That is if you care anything about world leaders having any confidence with even future Presidents.  In hindsight, Trump shouldn't of caved and released this one.  He tried to do the ""right"" thing and it still wasn't good enough"
democrats,TYT is a network named after a group who committed the Armenian Genocide. The actual Young Turks were an inspiration to Adolf Hitler. The founder of The Young Turks Network has repeatedly denied the Armenian Genocide happened and then after writing multiple times about the events that surrounded the Armenian Genocide said he did not know the major historical negative connection with the name Young Turks. Any video by him or his network should be treated the same as something out of InfoWars

Ban individuals who violate board policies otherwise stay out of it.  Reddit is shaping its content more and more.  That might be within their right, but it's not good overall.  "
Liberal,"That's just the cycle.  Things all go to shit under GOP presidencies, then the Dems come in and clean up the mess.  There was a brief period after the Depression and WWII that this changed but for the most part it's been trickle down into violent crash followed by a Keynesian cleanup."
Conservative,I don't know. I think this statement alone fits the caricature heading pretty well.
Conservative,"It's entertainment.  Substitute any other entertainment, be it movies, music, books, theater, what have you, and it's the same thing.    Nobody needs it, people enjoy it, it's a big business because there's demand for it, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with people making money in that business by taking part in the creation of something that entertains millions of people.  So it's not your type of entertainment, apparently.  Yeah, there are problems in the world, too, and I agree with some of the funding issues.  I don't think governments should pay for stadiums, etc., but governments pay for a lot that they shouldn't.  They subsidize the entire financial industry through direct loans at artificially low, practically free, interest rates to banks and by buying financial assets.  They do all kinds of shit that is economically idiotic, and sports is just one more example of it.  It could and should be funded completely privately, and it would still be profitable.  Sports isn't a problem.  Might not be your preferred entertainment, but we *should* have entertainment, and there's nothing wrong with humans competing like this.  And it's not just genetic determinism; if you believe that, you are quite wrong.  Genetics might be one aspect, but there's technique, and there's hard work, and there's coaching, and there's teamwork and strategy...  Imagine a world with no entertainment.  We wouldn't be better off because we have nothing to do but sit around thinking about our problems.  We'd just be less happy.  Just because it isn't your kind of entertainment, doesn't mean you're right to just imagine the whole thing is worthless and shouldn't exist.  A lot of people who think they're intellectuals take this tack, and it's utterly wrong, and ultimately it's an anti-freedom and anti-intellectual position to take."

I won't be having kids so whatever happens in the future isn't my concern.  I worked 3 minimum wage jobs. I survived on that and then moved up and out of that situation. The jobs were fucking easy, the people I worked with were unreliable and lazy. The ones who weren't quickly escaped. Ever think about why they pay minimum wage? It's because the jobs are a joke and almost anyone can do them. I worked at McDonald's, best buy, and cleaning up for a construction company for reference.   Why do progressives act like healthcare is such a difficult thing to get? It's really not. If people can't put in the minimum effort to get it, why should we provide it? Look around, America is filled with fat, lazy, disgusting individuals. If they can't get their act together, then fuck em.  The left's argument is always that the vast majority of people are good and hardworking and simply can't get ahead. If that were true, I'd agree with you. But in my experience, it's far from true. People are aren't working hard, they all want something for nothing, they want to blame others for their situation. And they deserve nothing. "
Conservative,I really wish they would both just shut up so I could vote for them and not feel too bad about myself for doing it.
Conservative,"I am not saying that McConnell is right.  I'm saying that I kinda sorta see where he was going.  Usually Obama has a big media push to get what he wants...that was missing this time, in my opinion.  Not that I miss hearing Obama lecture us.  But this was something the people wanted...or enough people wanted and Congress reacted.  It's hard to say...maybe it was just a big F U from Congress letting Obama know that it's time to move on.  I really don't think that any law suit will produce any results... it'll all be show for election season, but who knows?  Maybe we did open a Pandora's Box?"
Conservative,Does it matter? Muslim on non-Muslim violence is a hot topic in the US right now. It's no surprise this is being talked about.
Conservative,"Believe you me, I looooooove to rip on Hillary Clinton. She is a lying, incompetent, power-hungry criminal and I think she deserves to be behind bars, not running for office. I also think she is very capable of something like this.   However, this does not appear be a genuine case of fraud. Look at the picture in the article, the words ""Ballot Box"" look photoshopped onto the boxes. (Edit: notice how the words on each box are the same size, regardless of how forward or back the box is? Notice how the text are all perfectly horizontal regardless of the orientation of the box?) CTN has made equally dubious claims in the past. Again, I'm all for exposing Hillary for what she is, but this is not the way to do it. "

Conservative,"I don’t really agree with your first paragraph. The problem is that minorities (in that case the LGBTQ+ community) always had to claim their rights publicly. A ""do your things in private and I’m good with you"" mentality would work if those people could live like anyone of the majority, which wasn’t and still isn’t the case. So yeah, I don’t really see this as shoving your sexuality down someone’s throat, but more as a way (probably the only one) to try and get closer to a situation where everyone can equally mind their own business (of course, there are extremes on both sides, which are amplified on the internet)."

Conservative,"This exactly.  Even states, cities providing tax incentives/breaks to business is bad in the long run.  It promotes businesses to shop around for the best breaks.   It also weakens competitiveness as a whole.  "
Conservative,"That's bullshit. Those ""9000 lies"" are full of things like trump saying something like 'this happened 132,000 times"", when it really happened 131,872 times. Also a fuck load of them are trump joking, by the way hes hilarious, but the left is immune to recognizing trump making a joke and takes everything he says seriously.  He is not a liar, he acts like a normal person rather than a politician and the left hates that and doesnt understand how to react to it.  Also he never obstructed justice, providing 1.4 million documents, allowing 500 people to testify, asking Comey to investigate anyone in his campaign Comey thought may have broken the law. That is the opposite of obstructing justice.   There was no collusion, the Steele dossier was paid for by the clinton campaign and the dnc, was written by a former British spy who got the disinformation from two Russian officials close to Putin.   This was all an attempted coup against trump, and before that an attempt at preventing trump from winning the election."
Conservative,"I’ll keep my response brief, but Trump is NOT a conservative. Conservatives are allowed to like him. He is doing a decent job with the Republican agenda. But he is really not conservative in the traditional sense."

Not only are you a misogynistic and chauvinistic, disappointing example of a husband, your Islamophobic statement also shows more ignorance and prejudice on your part.

If Russia invaded the Baltics, you know damn well neither Spain, Italy or Germany would do jack shit about it. Germany would just hem and haw and pretend like they're afraid of their own militarization while lowkey building another sweetheart oil pipeline to Russia; France would apologize because their forces are bogged down securing blood diamonds; Italy would just laugh about its one leaky aircraft carrier; and Spain would act like they control the southern rather than northern border.."
Conservative,"A lot of people are in the same boat that I'm in. I think he's going to be an awful president, but I think we have to stop Clinton at all costs, even if it means electing this liberal.

We need to hold him to it as voters, but there is a chance that he could save one branch of government (judicial); oddly enough, that won't be the branch he heads (executive)."

Conservative,What tweet are you talking about? I don't see it in the article.
Conservative,"First, I appreciate you taking the time to look at the link and respond. Second, for those downvoting, this is dialogue — one that has so far avoided ad hominem and  other fallacies. If you disagree with my premise and/or conclusion let me know why, but downvoting because you disagree with polite discourse is immature and serves no purpose in a forum.   I don’t disagree with fact the following fact:  &gt;	amateur satellite observers regularly track it across the sky, allowing its orbit to be determined   Despite the ability to track a classified satellite one won’t know what the satellite’s purpose and technical capability actually is.  Inferring a country has a capability and knowing what that capability is are two entirely different things.    There is a strategic advantage to having this information unknown to potential and current adversaries.    I have no idea what protocol president Trump went through to release this information, nor do you. I do know that he has been liable in the last to act impulsively. I will give the benefit of the doubt on this one as information in top left corner is redacted, but that could be for a number of reasons. However, saying it doesn’t include any classified information is patently false — we have never seen a satellite with such impressive resolution and this capability was classified up until the point President Trump tweeted it.   For reference, the last satellite imagery declassified was Hexagon. It operated in the 1970’s. It was only declassified in 2011.    Is this the biggest mistake ever made? No.  Do I think of it as an unnecessary and careless release of sensitive information? Yes.    As a note - even if his security advisors said, “I’d rather you didn’t share that information for reasons X, Y, and Z.” President Trump still has the authority to tweet it if he so chooses."

Conservative,Yes and who determines criminal activity?  Is US law now the laws that the whole world must follow?  The US also has secret courts that give out secret orders. How are we to know that there are not orders that are censorship that are hidden behind secret warrants?  The american first amendment means jack shit when it doesn't apply to anyone except Americans. I am not protected overseas by the first amendment. My website that is hosted abroad is not subject to US laws and it is also not subject to US protections.  My internet usage is monitored on mass by the US government precisely because i am not protected by American Law. Anyone who does not live in America either personally or virtually has precisely zero rights. This means that the only protection is for Americans and the rest of the world is left spinning in the Breeze.   This is the case no matter what country has ICANN which is precisely why it needs to be taken out of any countries control. Cruz is not railing to protect Americans from censorship because they are always protected no matter what by the first amendment. He is railing so that America retains the right to Censor the rest of the world as it currently has the ability to do.   No country should be in control of the internet. ICANN must be a completely autonomous body that answers to nobody whatsoever put into trust with relevant rules decided by the world and then left alone.  
Conservative,"&gt;I abide neither sycophantism nor homerism. You seem to cling to both like pacifiers.   As you cling to your principles and your ankles.

Wish in one hand and shit in the other, see which ones fills up first. When you are done, go yell at the clouds some more.   &gt;This might surprise you but he's not a god, and blindly defending someone even when they do wrong makes you no better and just as dishonest as the morons on the left.  Do you have trouble reading? I already said that Trump has many flaws.   &gt;If all conservatism is are phyric victories won over democrats then it is nothing but an empty husk that'll soon die.   This is rich considering your principles have been losing against Democrats for decades. Were you asleep during the 2016 election? Do you honestly believe that 150 new federal judges and two supreme court justices were the product of principles? They were appointed because of Trump, the flawed candidate and president that tore up your rules and won an election.  Now he is fighting once again and you can't help but latch onto his leg and whine. Well look at the other leg, you are in the company of leftists.   &gt;Principles and convictions should be timeless and surpass party.

He's so ""pro-life"" that he shut down women's health centers that don't even provide abortions, just medical treatments and check ups, etc... He also says that condoms, which have existed for over 10,000 years, are too modern for him, pushing abstinence-only education in schools. He shut down a needle exchange program for drug addicts against the advice of scientists and factual information because he personally thought that it would make the problem worse. He actually created an AIDS epidemic in his state.  Meanwhile, the Clinton foundation [helps millions of HIV positive people worldwide to afford their medication](http://www.politifact.com/global-news/statements/2016/jun/15/hillary-clinton/clinton-clinton-foundation-helped-9-million-lower-/) so that should give you a good side-by-side.

Conservative,"The carnival of lip-quivering, loud-mouthed babies."
Conservative,"This is the actual quote:  “Some are new to politics completely. They’re children of the Great Recession. And they are living in their parents’ basement. They feel they got their education and the jobs that are available to them are not at all what they envisioned for themselves. And they don’t see much of a future. If you’re feeling like you’re consigned to, you know, being a barista, or you know, some other job that doesn’t pay a lot, and doesn’t have some other ladder of opportunity attached to it, then the idea that maybe, just maybe, you could be part of a political revolution is pretty appealing,”"

Conservative,"I had a bad feeling, but if this was all a ploy to aid Hillary I don't think her camp would be attacking Comey.  I think they would have just said ""he's just doing his due diligence, there's nothing new that they'll find."""
Conservative,"I would agree with your statement. He's a winner, so he should just be, y'know, winning by definition."

Conservative,"To be fair, the US is also a lot bigger in both population and land area. Thanks for replying to my sarcastic comment though. I can see how you would feel safer, but in the US, at least in my case for example, I live 45 minutes from the nearest police station in the middle of nowhere. I can't rely on them to protect my property, and I feel safer with my rifles and ability to conceal carry. Different strokes for different folks I suppose. "
Conservative,you are dense because the main point of my argument is to vote for a person who shares the same values as you. and if you dont think hillary is a big bad evil person than i have some news for you.

Liberal,"That's the point. To say ""college kids are like this"" and have a book and go on a talk show about it, when you can waive it away by saying ""not all are exactly alike"" is exactly the issue.

Conservative,i am voting for him based on sharing similar beliefs. also its exactly how voting works unfortunately. its a kindergarten candy land unrealistic mentality to believe that there are not wasted votes. just like how me voting republican while being a new yorker is pretty much a waste because the shitty electoral college will guarantee that my red vote in a blue state means less than the curtain on the voting booth.

Conservative,Did you read my comment? It must have felt good to type all this out but it's not relevant to what I said at all. Trump said he was a smart business man for taking advantage of the tax code right. The same thing can be said for UTC moving jobs overseas. That's all I'm saying.

Conservative,"&gt; ""While some Democrats may occasionally dine at Chick-fil-A (and perhaps even members of the LGBT community), the coordination of Pinellas voter registration activities with this right-leaning business very clearly conveys that your office is targeting Republican-leaning voters,"" McGrath wrote.

Democrats tried to make Chick-fil-A into a political wedge issue a few years ago and it backfired on them. There were much longer lines than the usual long lines at every Chick-fil-A in the country.   "

Republican,"This isn't really all that accurate considering two of these - Ohio and Florida - were close to begin with.

Conservative,"1. Yes, they are things that will happen when we decide who gets to come here legally and who doesn’t. We get to decide how many people we let in each year and where they come from. You don’t just get to cross the border illegally and force a country to let you live there. That’s not how it works.   2. You are absolutely correct, this is for the judges to decide as they are doing now. While waiting for the judges to hear the cases the ‘asylum seekers’ are held in detention centers, built, maintained, and funded under the previous administration for this exact reason.   3. Would you call it a shit hole country? Cause you’re not allowed to do that. Sure there are parts of Mexico that are run by the cartels that suck but there are also many other parts away from the major drug trafficking routes where the cartels do not have influence and are quite nice.   There are places in the US where homicides occur almost daily, people are living in the streets and begging for spare change, and drugs are ruining the lives of millions, just like in Mexico. In some cities you have to dodge human shit and used syringes just walking down the street. There are many other places in the US that are quite nice where drugs, crime, and homicides are virtually nonexistent just like in Mexico.  Yes the constitution allows for immigration. It allows us to decide who gets to come and where they come from. There is a legal process you go through to immigrate to the United States and there always has been. What we are talking about specifically is illegal immigration. We do not have open borders although it sounds as if you believe that we do or should."

Conservative,This has to have been taken out of context. 
Conservative,"Ok your ""honor"". First off, it's not ""marriage"" it's just marriage between two consenting adults. To not allow it because you're ""family first"" is just idiotic. But more importantly, the Federal courts declared it legal. You no longer get a say in whether or not it's allowed because it's already been determined that it's allowed."

Conservative,"&gt;In several years, when we have accomplished all of our enforcement goals – and truly ended illegal immigration for good, including the construction of a great wall, and the establishment of our new lawful immigration system – then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those who remain. That discussion can only take place in an atmosphere in which illegal immigration is a memory of the past, allowing us to weigh the different options available based on the new circumstances at the time.  So what will have changed in several years to make ""new circumstances""?  Why wouldn't you straight up deport these people like he originally said?"
Conservative,"Please do not use their language- she didn’t ask for the removal of immigrants, she asked for the removal of illegal aliens."

He also said that his testimony before Congress will not go beyond the Report, which is his testimony, and does not contain any criminal activity by the President of the United States.  We already know what Mueller will say, because Mueller has already said it.   It is not me who is having trouble hearing what Mueller has said. It's you. The President is an innocent man.  The President has made mistakes, and has done the wrong thing at times. But on the whole, he has done a fantastic job as President."
Conservative,"Agreed, so I'm not sure why he wouldn't just deport them all.... Why would you need to see what the ""new circumstances"" are in a few years?  Would they not be criminals simply because the border is secure?  &gt;In several years, when we have accomplished all of our enforcement goals – and truly ended illegal immigration for good, including the construction of a great wall, and the establishment of our new lawful immigration system – then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those who remain.

Conservative,"I believe you are right. I also know that Mr. Trump is not so successful. Had he simply put his wealth in a NYSE index, he would be much richer than he is estimated to be.  Money comes from two sources: merit and luck. Trump was lucky to be the heir of a billionnaire. This is the extent of his talent. He hasn't shown any other talent than being good at being born. His professional life seems to be 'okaying' decisions by underlings, playing golf, and going on a stupid reality tv show. There is no reason to believe he is a good business strategist -- he failed too many times (Trump Steak? Really?) -- or an honest one.  He had multiple bankruptcies which were entirely avoidable. He is constantly sued and loses often. He conned folks with Trump University. You have to face it, America has elected a conman and will pay the price.  Learn some manners, young man. You cannot tell people who disagree with you that they're living with their parents. You are needlessly rude and inconsiderate, and thus probably slow-witted. There is no gain in insulting people who have not insulted you."

Conservative,"But that wasn't Sanders' argument. The point is that his logic was terrible. A is not a crime, therefore A should incur no costs and be subsidised by the gov't. Knowles simply applied it to another situation to show how illogical it is.  As others have said, education is so expensive precisely because gov't keeps getting involved. When it comes to useful degrees with a tangible connection to getting a well-paying job at the end, a free market has adequate ways to fund that - scholarships, for example.  Politicians say education is a good investment. Well, to the extent that that's true, investors will invest in it of their own accord, like anything else! Some boxing coaches give free lessons in the hope that one of their trainees will become a success and be able to pay them back. Similarly, colleges could charge a percentage of earnings once a graduate gets a job and otherwise provide education for free. But while the gov't subsidises them and enforces all kinds of rules, that's not gonna happen - certainly not to the same degree.  And let's not conflate all college degrees into the same class - engineering and gender studies are not equally useful or worth investing in. Many students are not there to learn or take things seriously, they're there to socialise, explore, find themself or other vague ways to waste tax-payer money."
Conservative,I would like to have anyone explain to me why we even need congress any more.  The regime does whatever it wants.  No one stops them.  Their stooges waste everyone's time by telling lie after lie without repercussion.  There are no laws.

The same old insane Trump #1 fan chants and a new one [""string her up](https://twitter.com/ndrew_lawrence/status/771169474833637376/video/1).  This is all very terrifying to be honest.
