### LAB 4

Makes every knowledge learned in lab 1, 2, and 3, into a pipeline, to fit the data into the model and predict.

### LAB 5

States how the lecturer expects the code to look like. It seems like it needs to be clean, structured, and separated.
Gave example and layout on how the README file for an academic paper should be. Introduced the idea of a factory class. 
Each class should ideally be in a separate file. To perform hyper-parameter tuning, try one of the recommended
libraries, as scikit-learn can take too long. Use a logging tool, to keep track of changes and versions.

### LAB 6

There is a mix in between Information Extraction and Deep Learning. Shows the 3 ways to evaluate a model; publication,
data, and qualitative analysis. Gave an example of 2 different types of models (they can all be found in the ModelHub).
There also exists a DatasetHub, which is useful to compare the models between each other. To detect entities, apply NER.
Example of SpaCy model as well as it visualizer (with library). The code to visualize changes depending on whether you
are using jupyter or not.
