### LAB 4

Makes every knowledge learned in lab 1, 2, and 3, into a pipeline, to fit the data into the model and predict.

### LAB 5

States how the lecturer expects the code to look like. It seems like it needs to be clean, structured, and separated. Each class should ideally be in a separate file.
